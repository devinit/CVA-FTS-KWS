Leur rapatriement n'est pas envisageable dans l'immédiat à cause de l'insécurité et instabilité persistants dans leur pays d'origine.  Ils ont toujours besoin de la protection internationale et de l’assistance multisectorielle leur permettant de mener une vie digne et en toute sécurité. Les services de santé, de nutrition, d'éducation, d'eau et assainissement nécessitent d'être maintenus et améliorés  en vue de  réduire la vulnérabilité des  réfugiés tout en tenant compte de leur âge, genre et diversité. Quatre-vingt pourcent des refugies n’ont pas n’ont pas accès aux moyens de subsistance, il y a nécessité de  renforcer leur résilience et  leur auto-prise en charge progressive."

Libyan law does not make a distinction between people in need of international protection, victims of trafficking and others and as a result, migrant populations in Libya face widespread discrimination and marginalisation and are often denied access to healthcare or other services, and endure harsh shelter conditions. In the absence of the rule of law, and judicial oversight or accountability for the abuses they face, migrants are targeted in a context where ‘police, militias, smugglers, traffickers, criminal gangs, and civilians detain migrants, asylum seekers and refugees with impunity, use them to extort money or force them into unpaid labour.’  They are at risk of arbitrary detention, torture, execution, rape, abduction for ransom, forced labour, kidnapping, slavery, deportation and the risk of refoulment is a consistent threat.

La crise économique et les 16 mesures d'austérité affectent profondément le domaine de l'éducation. De plus, le manque d'enseignants qualifiés dans les écoles de la région du Lac atteint un niveau critique : 30% des écoles primaires du Canton de Bol Rural (20 sur 65) étaient encore fermées en décembre 2016 faute d'enseignants ou de maîtres communautaires (Entretien avec l'inspecteur en charge de l'éducation formelle de l'inspection de Bol Rural - 09/2016).
Le secteur de l'éducation dépend des interventions humanitaires avec des maîtres communautaires actuellement rémunérés uniquement par les acteurs de l'aide internationale, via le Partenariat Mondial pour l'Éducation (GPE). Cependant, les activités d'éducation financées par le GPE via l'UNICEF ne permettent de couvrir qu'un quart des besoins de la région. Le projet mis en place par HI et COOPI à partir d'avril 2016 a également confirmé le besoin important d'éducation et de soutien aux plus vulnérables, particulièrement les enfants non accompagnés (ENA), les enfants seuls (ES), les enfants handicapés (EH) et les filles. Dans les localités enquêtées de la zone d'intervention, le taux de scolarisation en premier cycle estimé est de 24% seulement (Enquêtes HI-COOPI novembre-décembre 2016)."

It includes high impact efforts aimed at protecting people from danger, helping victims become self-sufficient and active members of their communities and providing opportunities for sustainable development and stability. Providing EOD trainings will allow EOD operators to carry out EOD tasks more safely and efficiently. Explosive remnants of war (ERW) contamination has restricted access to basic services, led to displacement and impacted people’s safety and security. The conflict has affected hundreds of thousands of people across the country living in unsafe conditions, including IDPs, returnees, most vulnerable non-displaced Libyans, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. Insecurity related to the presence of explosive hazards continue to be a barrier to return. EOD operations are crucial for ensuring safe return of IDPs, economic recovery and access to social services for communities and vulnerable groups. Mine action interventions and EOD clearance also facilitate other humanitarian sectoral responses by allowing safe access for humanitarian actors. In addition, each EOD training includes advance first-responder medical course that contributes to protect EOD operators themselves and to save lives.  This project will contribute to make Libya more safe and secure.
UNMAS Libya is an active member of the Protection Working Group and makes protection central to its humanitarian interventions. UNMAS Libya is also an active member of the Conflict Sensitive Assistance to Libya co-hosted by UNDP Libya and the Swiss Embassy to Libya and participates in the joint conflict analysis Forum. To prevent and minimize any unintended negative effects that could increase people's vulnerability and expose people to further harm, UNMAS Libya constantly analyses risks people face, threats, vulnerabilities and capacities and identifies measures to reduce those risks in the planning and implementation process. To ensure that the affected population is not subject to violence or violations of their rights, that the provided assistance does not undermine their capacities, and the tasks of security institutions dealing with EOD are conducted in line with international human rights standards, UNMAS is coordinating with UNSMIL's Human Rights Division for the vetting of the security institutions' personnel designated to attend specialized EOD trainings, to check trainees' background in order to prevent any abuse of rights on the ground. In its interventions, UNMAS Libya interventions focuses on empowerment of local stakeholders by providing technical assistance and specialized capacity enhancement trainings. UNMAS Libya has also incorporated presentations on human rights principles into the specialized trainings programme to increase awareness and commitment of the trained personnel dealing with EOD activities."

UNMAS Libya provides support and assistance on the basis of identified needs and always focuses on continual improvement and learning. To this end, UNMAS Libya has developed appropriate mechanisms to ensure that lessons learned and feedback from participants are collected and incorporated in all current and future projects.
UNMAS is also conducting Quality Assurance of each trainings and Quality Assurance visits are systematically conducted by the UNMAS Operations Team to ensure Quality standards are applied and identified needs are met. Quality criteria are included in the procurement process led by UNOPS and UNMAS to ensure high quality delivery of the specialized trainings and equipment by the Contractor. UNMAS Libya pays special attention to monitoring and evaluation and risk assessments during planning, implementation and reporting. Pre and post evaluation of the trainees are conducted at the beginning and at the end of the trainings, and the organisations who are receiving specialized trainings and equipment are requested to report on the activities carried out by the trainees with the equipment provided."
52428,2018,"2600430",5683,"Libya Humanitarian Response Plan 2018","Protection","5311","United Nations Mine Action Service","Needs","The need in Libya for qualified EOD teams is extreme. As indicated in the DTM round 8 on explosive hazards contamination threat perception, the presence of explosive hazards was reported in 9 baladiyas. The threat or presence of explosive hazards is hindering the return of 8% of IDPs and preventing ability to move safely within baladiya. DTM round 12 indicates that the awareness of the presence of Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) was reported in 14% of baladiyas. As identified in the humanitarian needs analysis, the threat of explosive hazards is an overarching concern for the protection sector and the severity of needs points to an acute and immediate need of humanitarian assistance in nine mantikas. Civilians continue to be killed and maimed, exposed to explosive hazards that affect lives, physical security and access to essential services. .
However, the capacity of National Security Institutions to carry out clearance of explosive hazards is severely limited by the lack of adequately trained personnel and equipment. EOD operators are suffering worrying rates of attrition and volunteers are carrying out clearance tasks with little or no training or equipment. The work is difficult and dangerous. Since 2016, more than 50 EOD operators lost their lives while dealing with explosive hazards. 
This project will enhance the capacity of national institutions to deal with the threat from explosive hazards and will allow their teams to work more safely and efficiently by providing them with specialized training and equipment. Mine Action activities in emergencies is essential to allow affected populations to live their daily lives and move without fear and for humanitarian agencies to deliver assistance. Mine action is fully integrated in the overall humanitarian response"

UNMAS Libya as a member of the Protection Sector, will also coordinate among UN agencies, funds, programmes, and mine action partners to exchange information, increase efficiency, and promote overall  coherence in prioritization, and operations. UNMAS Libya also closely coordinates its projects with its Libyan counterparts, the National Mine Action Centre (LibMAC), which coordinates EOD clearance activities at the national level, as well as its operational branch that assigns task orders to clearance teams. UNMAS Libya also coordinates with the Security Institutions responsible for EOD who designate operators to attend specialized EOD trainings.  As the Arms and Ammunition Advisory Section of UNSMIL's Security Institutions Division, UNMAS Libya is key to facilitating strategic planning, in terms of addressing both the ERW and IED threats in Libya, to coordinate humanitarian mine action operations and to support capacity development initiatives. UNMAS Libya also coordinates its projects with the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) since it is a programme implemented by UNOPS in accordance with the Financial Rules and Regulations of UNOPS, but under the overall oversight and strategic direction of the United Nations Mine Action Service, a section of the UN Secretariat’s Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) in New York."

52697,2018,"1724178",5684,"Tchad Plan de Réponse Humanitaire 2018","Education","2915","United Nations Children's Fund","Needs","Since the outbreak of conflicts in Sudan in 2003 and in the Central African Republic (CAR) in 2013, about 400,000 refugees have settled in Chad. About 196,000 of them are estimated to be school aged children between the ages of 3 and 17 years. Despite the efforts to provide the refugee children with access to a quality education, lack of educational infrastructure, low quality of teaching and impoverished communities have been major obstacles. 
In places where schools do not have enough classrooms, temporary learning spaces with basic WASH facilities can help increase access to education for CAR refugee children. Children and teachers will also need basic materials to facilitate effective learning and teaching. In order to address both the immediate and longer-term needs of the population, local capacity building should be prioritized as a means of enhancing community resilience against crisis. Local educational authorities will therefore need to be supported for effective coordination of emergency education activities and development of a contingency plan for the education sector. Moreover, it is necessary to train members of the Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs) and Educating Mothers’ Associations (EMAs) to strengthen their roles and responsibilities in school management and development of income generating activities around schools affected by crisis. Female members of the associations will be further trained to help adolescent girls adopt appropriate hygiene practices in school during the menstruation period and maintain school attendance. 
It is expected that strengthened community involvement will gradually allow crisis-affected communities to become a key actor in increasing access to educational opportunities and improving the quality of education for their children. Additionally, the intersectoral approaches developed with WASH, Health, Nutrition and Child Protection will contribute to survival and protection of children through education."

52701,2018,"2575693",5684,"Tchad Plan de Réponse Humanitaire 2018","Education","2915","United Nations Children's Fund","Needs","Since the outbreak of conflict in the Central African Republic (CAR) in 2013, about 73,000 Chadians in CAR returned to Chad. About 36,000 of them are estimated to be school aged children between the ages of 3 and 17 years. Some of them have settled in returnee sites and others in host communities. This demographic influx of returnees placed additional strain on the already burdened and structurally weak education system in Chad. It had a significant impact on the host populations as they have to share the already limited resources. In total, it is estimated that about 141,000 host community populations are affected by the population movements in the south of Chad. 
The most needed interventions are providing additional spaces through construction of temporary learning spaces and teaching/learning materials to facilitate learning and teaching; and teacher training in peace education, life skills and psychosocial support for crisis-affected children to better equip them with the necessary knowledge. In addition to supporting children and teachers, it will be key to build local capacity in providing educational services. Local educational authorities will therefore need to be supported for effective coordination of emergency education activities and development of a contingency plan for the education sector. Moreover, it is necessary to train members of the Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs) and Educating Mothers’ Associations (EMAs) to strengthen their roles and responsibilities in school management and development of income generating activities around schools affected by crisis. Female members of the associations will be further trained to help adolescent girls adopt appropriate hygiene practices in school during the menstruation period and maintain school attendance. 
It is expected that strengthened community involvement will gradually allow crisis-affected communities to become a key actor in increasing access to educational opportunities and improving the quality of education for their children. Additionally, the intersectoral approaches developed with WASH, Health, Nutrition and Child Protection will contribute to survival and protection of children through education."

UNHAS provides safe, efficient and effective air transport service to some 99 organizations from NGOs, UN Agencies, Diplomatic Corps, and the Donor community. Users in Chad carry out and monitor humanitarian activities but also development projects in remote areas of Chad.
UNHAS is the only reliable air service in the country. 19 destinations are served within Chad and a connection to Cameroon is also provided (Yaounde via Maroua).
Operating with a fleet of 4 aircraft, two 37-seat Emb135 jet/Dash8 and two 12-seat Cessna Caravan aircrafts strategically positioned in N’djamena, Yaounde, Abeche and Gozbeida, UNHAS provides prompt access to populations in need in the country and also provides inter-regional flights between Chad and Cameroon in response to the emergency crises in Cameroon. 
In a country with vast distances and limited medical facilities, UNHAS also ensures medical and security evacuations for humanitarian and development workers.
As part of its mandaste to provide safe and efficient services, UNHAS dedicates staff and resources for airstrip rehabilitation, airstrip safety and security across Chad. UNHAS maintains 15 of the 19 airfields which it serves in the country and collaborates closely with local authorities to ensure the maintenance of the remaining four. Moreover, UNHAS contributes to strengthening national capacity by providing training to local civil aviation authority personnel."

Distances between the main areas of humanitarian and development activity and organizations’ bases of operation are vast with poor road conditions. Road travel is also perennially affected by seasonal weather as several roads are impassable during the rainy season (June to mid-October). Moreover, insecurity renders road travel very hazardous. According to the UN security classification system, most of Chad is at security level 2, while areas in the East and Southeast are at security level 3. The public sector came to a halt during the last quarter of 2016 due to several months of unpaid salaries. The disruption is largely attributed to economic crises and has raised the fear that affected workers may resort to violence or other negative coping mechanisms including crime. Road travel is considered unsafe under the circumstances for security reasons. Under the prevailing conditions, air travel is the most reliable and safe means for humanitarian and development workers to travel safely from N’Djamena, Abeche and Goz-Beida to more than 15 locations in Western, Southern, Central and Eastern Chad."

Les violences basées sur le genre sont récurrentes, croissantes et répandues au sein de toutes les couches de la population affectée par la crise. Les activités de sensibilisation et de réponses ont été menées mais faute de ressources, ces activités ne couvrent pas un grand nombre de la population affectée. Dans les sites de Danamadja et Kobiteye, on note un arrêt d’actions laissant les survivants/victimes sans réponse. Celles-ci sont exposées à tous les risques de violences basées sur le genre, de santé et de discrimination/stigmatisation. Les principales catégories sont les violences sexuelles, les agressions physiques, le mariage d’enfants, les dénis de ressources, les violences psychologiques et aussi l’exploitation et l’abus sexuel qui constitue un phénomène négatif d’adaptation communément appelé « sexe pour la survie ».

52802,2018,"2500000",5684,"Tchad Plan de Réponse Humanitaire 2018","Protection","4293","United Nations Population Fund","Needs","Au Tchad, la crise centrafricaine affectent plusieurs personnes dont plus de 154 000 de personnes en besoin d’assistance en protection. Le sous-financement de cette crise a provoqué le départ progressif des partenaires. Le niveau de vulnérabilité est élevé et surtout le secteur de réponse aux Violences Basées sur le Genre (VBG). Les évaluations multisectorielles de mai et d’août 2017 dont relevées des besoins urgents.
Les VBG sont récurrents. Toutes les formes sont enregistrées y compris l’exploitation/abus sexuel et le  phénomène négatif d’adaptation  et de survie appelé  ‘’ sexe pour la survie’’, exposant les femmes, filles à tous les risques de violences basées sur le genre, de maladies et de discrimination/stigmatisation. Les conséquences qui en découlent sont les traumatismes, les contaminations aux ITS/VIH/Sida, les avortements, mariages précoces/grossesses non désirées et précoces, morbidité/mortalité, la déscolarisation, la perte de dignité,… Les auteurs des VBG ne sont pas punis faute de  dénonciation  par peur ou par ignorance, aussi les dispositions juridiques et les institutions judiciaires sont peu favorables à l’accès à la justice ou à la protection.
À ce jour, Les conditions de vie des femmes/filles demeurent préoccupantes car les moyens de subsistance sont limités, les mécanismes locaux de protection sont inadéquats. A cela s’ajoutent les croyances socioculturelles, la situation de dependance, les causes structurelles qui  limitent l'autonomisation des femmes et adolescentes et justifient les VBG. Elles demeurent de groupes plus vulnérables. Il n'existe aussi pas de espaces sûrs pour l'acceuil de survivant(e)s de VBG.
Récemment, la réponse aux besoins humanitaires a été apporté y compris en le transfert monétaire mais le secteur protection reste sous financé. La situation de cette population risque de se détériorer davantage si la réponse en protection n’est pas renforcée. 
C'est pourquoi, ce projet s’articulera sur les risques de protection liés au transfert monétaires que sont les violences conjugales liées à l’accès ou l’utilisation équitable de transfert au sein des ménages en raison du rôle dominant du chef de ménage ou de la situation de polygamie dans laquelle se trouvent certains ménages, les mariages précoces et le mariage forcé, le déni de ressources, l’utilisation des enfants surtout les adolescentes dans les travaux, l’accompagnement des populations affectées et particulièrement les personnes vulnérables et la réponse à toutes les formes de VBG.
Des mécanismes locaux de prévention des VBG et de gestion des litiges seront renforcés. Des consultations seront faites afin de répondre efficacement aux besoins des bénéficiaires. Les axes seront : la mitigation les risques de protection, l’accès aux services de prise en charge holistique, le renforcement des capacités économiques et le transfert des notions de compétences courant de vie pour des bénéficiaires.
Les groupes les plus vulnérables et à risque sont les femmes ou mineurs-chefs de ménages, les femmes seules, les adolescent(e)s; les personnes ayant des besoins spéciaux ; les survivantes de violence basées sur le genre, les enfants et les personnes âgées.
Tous ceci pour permettre le respect des droits, la protection des groupes vulnérables, la participation et l’autonomisation des personnes affectées.

Cet état des faits est exacerbée par l’importance du nombre de réfugiés, des retournés et de déplacés.  Le Sud du Tchad, situé aux confins de la République Centrafricaine et du Soudan, a connu d'énormes problèmes liés à l'insécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle dus non seulement à l'arrivée massive des retournées et refugiés de ces pays frères, mais aussi aux effets liés aux changements climatiques (sécheresse, inondations) entraînant de mauvaises productions. En effet, les régions du Logone Oriental, du Mandoul, du Moyen Chari et du Salamat qui ont reçu de plein fouet les effets collatéraux de ces crises ainsi que celles bordant ces régions, nécessitent un appui conséquent en renforcement des moyens d'existence des ménages vulnérables. Aussi, les productions céréalière et oléagineuse ainsi que maraîchère vont être privilégiées pour accompagner la diversité alimentaire afin d'améliorer le niveau nutritionnel des personnes affectées. De même, un appui en outils agricoles et matériel de transformation et de conservation est-il nécessaire pour la réussite de cette opération. L'objectif du projet est d'améliorer la sécurité alimentaire et  nutritionnelle des communautés victimes de ces chocs et des effets de changement  climatique à travers le renforcement de leurs moyens d’existences"

52808,2018,"1200000",5684,"Tchad Plan de Réponse Humanitaire 2018","Health","4293","United Nations Population Fund","Needs","Conflicts in Central Africa Republic (CAR) caused moves of more than 100,000 people to Chad in 2014, fleeing violence. More than 75% among them are women and children. Up to date, returnees are estimated at about 72,559 people in Southern sites, of whom 42,223 in Moyen-Chari Region, 23,058 in Eastern Logone and 2,296 in Western Logone. In addition to 72,559 returnees, the host population is estimated at 410,878 inhabitants among whom 483,437 needing humanitarian assistance. Central African crisis has serious effects on the already low Chad health system. Health centers lack technical equipment, pharmaceuticals and qualified staff to offer sufficient quality medical services. 
Too impoverished, returnees and host communities are facing difficult situation concerning their medical care; as they do not have resources to go for medical treatment, they are used to practice self-medication. Moreover, there is insufficiency of staff in terms of quality and quantity, the non-adaptation of health centers to the actual difficult situation, shortage of essential pharmaceuticals stocks to save mothers and new–born babies’ lives. Critical insufficiencies are noted in reference and counter-reference system of obstetrical complications.
The health districts of Danamadji, Maro and Goré that cover responsibility zones of interventions, namely Sido, Maigama and Danamadji, show worrying maternal health indicators. Indeed, the 4th Pre-natal Consultation cover (minimum CPN according to WHO) is estimated at 10%, the child delivery rate in health structures is set at about 34%, identified and cared obstetrical complications measure 7% (out of 15% expected); the cesarean rate is low and estimated at 1% (standard between 5 and 15%), only 72 obstetrical complications cared for the whole region; the deadliness rate is high (3.5%, while the standard is under 1%) and the contraceptive prevalence rate estimated at 5% (DHS 2014-2015).
The last multi-disciplinary evaluation field trip conducted from May 11 to 14, 2017 in the South of the country showed a lack of staff and of essential pharmaceuticals to respond needs in regard of populations’ health. The mortality rate  in the site is beyond 10% according to reports received from sites. The most vulnerable people cover households led by women or children, people with specific needs, survivors of gender-based violence, child-bearing age women, pregnant women, women living alone or heads of households and aged people.
Humanitarian needs are too numerous in these above-listed locations causing difficult access to primary and secondary health care, including reproductive health, due to: 
-	The lack of resources and quality care;

-	The insufficiency of human resource, including female staff members, and of qualifications to provide services to children;

-	The lack of essential pharmaceuticals to heal major gynecological and child diseases (malaria, diarrhea, acute respiratory infections);

-	The lack of medical materials and equipment;

-	The low community sensitization related reproductive health issues;
-	The non-adaptation of services and the lack of strategy to target and reach the most vulnerable. 
Since the beginning of the humanitarian crisis, implemented interventions are showing added value. Thus, UNFPA interventions during this current year allowed taking care of 2,398 pre-natal consultations offered to 6,231 women, offering family planning services to 4,187 women, and providing support to five (5) health structures.
The large number of most often impoverished refugees and returnees caused the increase of needs for different categories of people under UNFPA mandate, composed by 120,859 child-bearing age women, 20,449 pregnant women, 18,921 new-born babies, 96,687 sexually active men, 1,022 pregnant women with signs of obstetrical complications, 2,417 survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, 169,203 teenagers and youths, 24,172 people infected by sexually transmitted infections.

Beyond the food and nutrition crisis that hampers the life of thousands of children, Chad has been hosting more refugees than any other countries in the region that continue to put an additional strain on the already overstretch resources. Years after the refugees and IDPs are settled in the eastern and southern regions the situation is not improving. The last nutrition survey conducted by UNHCR in these camps in 2016 revealed a rate of malnutrition as high as 9.2% but four camps out of 12 exceed the alarming rate of 10% with aggravating factors such as lack of livelihood activities. The food security and nutrition crisis that hit the Sahel regions affect these population as well with an increasing numbers of malnutrition among children including boys and girls. This situation results from the combination of several factors, including: (i) low food availability due to poor performance of production systems; (ii) low accessibility of populations to foodstuffs because of high prices and monetary poverty; (iii) unbalanced diet; (iv) inadequate infants and young child feeding practices; poor exclusive breastfeeding practices ; (v) Inadequate access to drinking water; (vi) persistence of traditional beliefs and low level of education of vulnerable people; (vii) Poor quality of health care; (viii) low coverage of basic social services and (xi) poor hygiene and sanitation conditions of an important segment of the population.
In view of this alarming situation, coordinated actions are needed to improve the nutritional and health status of populations in need in those regions through expansion and strengthening of health services to manage malnutrition, increasing health promotion and good nutritional practices for women and children.

52820,2018,"750000",5684,"Tchad Plan de Réponse Humanitaire 2018","Food Security","3230","Solidarités International","Needs","Selon la note de synthèse de l'enquête nutritionnelle (SMART, 2017) réalisée en juillet-août- 2017, le taux de malnutrition aigüe global (MAG) des enfants de 6-59 mois pour la région du Batha est de 22,1% dépassant le seuil d'urgence de l'Organisation Mondiale de la Santé (OMS) fixé à 15% et empirant par rapport à 2016. De même l'enquête SMART montre que la malnutrition aigüe sévère (MAS) n’a que peu évolué, passant de 4,3% en 2016 à 4,1%, toujours largement au-dessus du seuil d'alerte de 2%.
Les taux de malnutrition dans la zone d'intervention du projet, sont amplifiés en particulier par deux facteurs : 1/ Une insuffisance en terme d'accès à l'eau potable et à des conditions sanitaires saines et 2/ une insuffisance en terme de sécurité alimentaire et moyens d'existence des ménages.
On estime en effet qu'environ 50% de la malnutrition infantile est associée à la diarrhée ou à des infections répétées de nématodes intestinaux en raison de l'eau insalubre, d'un assainissement inadéquat ou de conditions d'hygiène insuffisante (Stratégie WASH in Nut Sahel, 2012-2013, groupe régional WASH)
Par ailleurs, les informations disponibles suite aux enquêtes réalisées par les équipes de SI dans le Fitri et le Batha-Ouest montrent que la situation est préoccupante concernant l'accès à l'eau potable, de l'hygiène et de l'assainissement
En termes de sécurité alimentaire, la situation reste critique et reste une cause principale de la malnutrition dans le pays.
Bien que l’enquête ENSA 2017 ne soit pas encore disponible, l'enquête ENSA d'octobre 2016 indiquait que le Fitri et le Batha ouest étaient respectivement dans une insécurité alimentaire globale moyenne (24%) et élevée (47,1%). La même enquête ENSA indiquait que 41,6% de la population du Batha avait une consommation alimentaire pauvre et limitée, peu diversifiée, pouvant mener à une augmentation des taux de malnutrition, surtout chez les individus les plus vulnérables c'est-à-dire les enfants et les FEFA, et nous doutons que la situation se soit améliorée en 2017. En effet, les résultats décevants de la campagne agricole 2017 (par rapport à ceux de 2016) soulignent la fragilité des moyens d'existence des ménages, soumis comme partout au Sahel à divers aléas dont les effets négatifs sont accrus par les faibles capacités d'adaptation et de résilience des communautés. On note par exemple que les terres de bérébéré (sorgho de décrue) sur lesquelles repose une partie importante de la production du Fitri, sont dans beaucoup de localités insuffisamment exploitées, voir abandonnées car elles ont perdu leur capacité de rétention d'eau (aussi bien celles issues du débordement du Lac Fitri que celles issues des eaux drainées par les petits cours d'eau) et leur fertilité. En effet, la disparition progressive du couvert végétal provoque d'une part l'érosion hydrique qui entraîne le ravinement des cours d'eau qui n'inondent plus suffisamment les terres à leur passage et d'autre part l'érosion éolienne qui entraîne le décapage des terres. Cette situation est aggravée par le manque d'entretien de ces terres par les usagers qui méconnaissent les techniques de défense et de restauration des sols ainsi que certaines bonnes pratiques permettant d'améliorer leurs systèmes de production. A cela s'ajoute la faiblesse des services techniques de l'Etat qui ne disposent pas de ressources (humaines, matérielles et financières) adéquates pour encadrer les producteurs. A terme, les terres deviennent incultes et peu productives, entraînant une faible disponibilité alimentaire qui contribue à l'augmentation des taux de malnutrition, surtout chez les enfants.
D'autre part, la région reste exposée à une soudure 2017, les récoltes ayant été inférieurs aux prévisions à cause d’une mauvaise pluviométrie, particulièrement en octobre  2017, ce qui accroit la pression sur les moyens d'existence des ménages, en particulier ceux n'ayant pas bénéficié de l'assistance humanitaire et qui se relèveront difficilement sans assistance."

•	Distribution d’un paquet minimum WASH aux ménages ayant un enfant MAS : 
•	Distribution de cash: les ménages ayant des enfants de 6-59 mois pris en charge pour la MAS bénéficieront d’un transfert monétaire afin de protéger la ration donnée aux enfants MAS c’est-à-dire éviter la revente et/ou le partage des intrants reçus pour la prise en charge thérapeutique de la MAS ou du kit WASH. 
•	Education des mères aux pratiques clés d’eau, hygiène et assainissement : les mères d’enfants de 6-59 mois et les FEFA seront sensibilisées sur: gestion appropriée de l’eau de boisson (puisage, transport, stockage et utilisation de l’eau) ; hygiène (lavage des mains avec du savon, lavage systématique des fruits et légumes, des ustensiles de cuisine...); assainissement (gestion adéquate des excrétas, propreté de l’habitat ...) et la prévention de la malnutrition infantile. 
Afin de soutenir les actions précédentes, SI soutiendra et renforcera les moyens d’existence et la résilience des communautés bénéficiaires :
 •	Reconstruction des actifs : Considérant l’importance de la culture du bérébéré (sorgho de décrue) dans le Fitri, SI soutiendra plusieurs localités où les terres de décrue sont peu ou pas inondées à les aménager à travers la construction de diguettes en terres et l’appui conseil dans la mise en valeur. D’autres types d’ouvrages appropriés aux bas-fonds (wadis) et/ou aux aires de pâturage seront réalisés dans la zone d’Abou Hadjilidj pour améliorer leur fertilité et leur capacité de production.
Cette action se fera à travers 2 principales modalités : 
a) sous forme de Cash For Assets, les ménages participants recevront du cash en échange des travaux effectués. 
b) SI fournira des caprins afin de permettre à ces ménages de construire un capital qui les soutiendra en cas de choc. En outre, les chèvres procureront du lait aux enfants de 6-23 mois. Les caprins distribués auront été préalablement achetés aux éleveurs très pauvres de la zone (voir activité de déstockage ci-dessous). 
Les actions de renforcement des actifs sont adressées aux ménages « Très pauvres » ayant des enfants de 6-59 mois et des FEFA.
•	Renforcer les moyens de production : SI appuiera les localités dans lesquelles les potentialités à développer le maraîchage existent, avec une dotation en intrants et matériels agricoles et accompagnement technique. 
•	Renforcer les capacités locales à travers les mécanismes/services de stockage (BC/BAB) et les services agricoles et vétérinaires mis en place par SI : le projet EuropeAid de SI a mis en place 11BC, 5 BAB, 13 brigadiers phytosanitaires et 10 auxiliaires d’élevage. Ces structures/services sont encore fragiles et ont besoin d’être davantage accompagnées pour renforcer leur fonctionnement et garantir leur durabilité. 
•	Déstockage préventif pour les ménages d’éleveurs très pauvres : Les revenus des éleveurs proviennent essentiellement de la vente d’animaux actuellement difficile du fait du ralentissement des échanges transfrontaliers avec le Nigeria et donc des prix de vente très bas. Afin de soutenir les ménages d’éleveurs, SI organisera une opération de déstockage en achetant à ces éleveurs, à un prix supérieur à celui du marché, 2 chèvres par ménage d’éleveurs « très pauvres"

Dans cette région, le profil épidémiologique des pathologies de l’enfant se caractérise par des maladies endémiques et saisonnières telles que les infections respiratoires aigües, le paludisme, la diarrhée et la malnutrition aiguë sévère (MAS). Le Kanem est parmi les régions plus affectées par la crise nutritionnelle, où la situation nutritionnelle des enfants de moins de 5 ans s’est considérablement dégradée et dépasse des seuils d’urgence avec des taux de MAG de 19,2% [15,4-23,7] en 2017 contre 14,9% [12,1-18,4] en 2016. Le taux de MAS est passé de 2,7%[ 1,8-4,1] en 2016  à 4,1% [2,8-5,9] en 2017. Au vu de cette forte prévalence, le Kanem fait partie des régions prioritaires ciblées par le cluster nutrition qui nécessitent une intervention d’urgence. Par ailleurs 50,8% [44,6-57,0] d’enfants souffriraient d’un retard de croissance contre 33,7% [28,8-39,0] en 2016. Selon la classification de l’OMS le Kanem fait partie des régions se trouvant dans une situation critique (MC >40%).La région est confrontée à une insuffisance des RH qualifiées, la plupart des CS sont sous équipées en matériel médical et tenues par un personnel non qualifié. La moyenne des consultations curatives est très faible, soit 0,3 contacts/perso/an. La région compte seulement environ 0,5 IDE/5000 et 0,14médecin/10000hab.). Les problèmes d’accès aux soins de santé de base, font que le système de référencement des cas de MAS avec complications repose sur les partenaires dans ce contexte où les CS sont très éloignés de l’hôpital régional (60% de la population vit à plus de 5 km d'un CS). 
Les pratiques néfastes à la santé représentent une forte pesanteur socio-culturelle ; la plupart des enfants hospitalisés dans les UNT sont admis avec des traumatismes causés par les guérisseurs traditionnels et les tradi-praticiens. Concernant l’allaitement maternel exclusif, il reste encore très faible avec 3,3% d’enfants allaités exclusivement au lait maternel pour une moyenne nationale de 5,52%. L’enquête CAP réalisée entre mai et juin 2016 révèle que 65% des ménages ne traitent pas l'eau de boisson alors que la défécation à l'air libre est pratiquée par 35% des personnes. La même étude révèle que le taux de prévalence de la diarrhée chez les moins de 5 ans reste assez élevé de l'ordre de 57%. Dans cette situation les enfants de moins de 5ans restent les exposés aux différentes maladies diarrhéiques.  
En matière de genre les discriminations envers les femmes demeurent encore très importantes, notamment : l’accès à l’éducation, à la propriété terrienne, aux soins de santé primaire et à l’emploi.. Les filles et les femmes sont confrontées aux violences conjugales, sexuelles et autres formes de violences basées sur le genre de manière particulièrement préoccupante ou environ 29% des mères se sont mariées à moins de 15 ans. Le manque d’accès aux informations et aux services de santé sexuelle et reproductive de qualité (consultations prénatales, accouchements assistés, planning familial) augmente le risque de mortalité lors de la grossesse et l’accouchement. 
A travers ce projet, ACF intègrera la dimension genre à chaque étape de son programme, pour les bénéficiaires directs, indirects et équipes ACF, afin de répondre de façon adaptée aux besoins de l’ensemble de la population. Les données seront ventilées par genre et par âge,  Les bénéficiaires de ce projet sont en majorité des enfants <5 ans, qui sont les plus vulnérables et leurs accompagnantes, les femmes enceintes et allaitantes, les femmes en âges de procréer. Le projet impliquera les communautés affectées, les femmes en particulier, lors de la conception / la planification , la mise en œuvre et le suivi des activités.

52615,2018,"682125",5684,"Tchad Plan de Réponse Humanitaire 2018","Nutrition","8501","Action Contre la Faim - France","Needs","La région du Lac Tchad se caractérise par une vulnérabilité à la fois conjoncturelle et structurelle aggravée par la crise de mouvement suite aux exactions commises par le groupe armé Boko Haram). Les vagues de déplacement des populations depuis 2015 ont entraîné 117 784 personnes déplacées et près de 8000 réfugiés (source CNARR et HCR). L’arrivée de ces populations a fortement augmenté les pressions sur les services sociaux de base, les ressources naturelles de la région et les moyens d’existence des communautés hôtes déjà faibles. Sur l’axe Ngouboua-Tchoukoutalia (district de Bagasola), au Sud-Ouest de la région, la population continue d’être affectée par plusieurs incidents liés aux attentats, attaques, enlèvements des femmes, vols de bétails… qui laissent de nombreuses séquelles post-traumatiques non-prises en charge.. Concernant la cuvette nord du district de Liwa le manque d’accès aux services de base est le même et les besoins en nutrition-santé, en Wash, en santé mentale et pratique de soins ne sont pas suffisamment couverts. Il faut noter que près de 90% des déplacés de la région du lac se localisent dans des sites et des villages d’accueil dans les districts de Bagasola et de Liwa n’offrant que très peu de possibilités en termes de développement des moyens de subsistance et d’accès aux travaux rémunérés. La majeure partie des CS du district de Liwa est enclavée, rendant donc leur accès (sécuritaire et physique) très difficile à un grand nombre de déplacés et même certains ménages hôtes.
Selon les résultats de l’enquête SAMRT 2017, la situation nutritionnelle des enfants de 6-59mois s’est dégradée ; la MAG est de 18,1% [15,3-21,3] et la MAS est de 3,4% [2,4-4,9] avec 40% [35,7- 44,5] d’enfants ayant un retard de croissance. Suite à cette situation le cluster nutrition place le Lac  parmi les  régions prioritaires qui nécessitent une réponse d’urgence . L’absence de gratuité de soins, le manque de médicaments essentiels, les problèmes de sécurité, etc. sont des facteurs qui contribuent au faible taux de fréquentation/utilisation des services par les communautés auquel s’ajoute une forte population de déplacés.Le taux d’accès à l’eau potable est de 34,5% à l’échelle de la sous-préfecture de Ngouboua mais ce chiffre ne traduit pas les disparités d’un village à l’autre et les maladies hydriques représentent 18% des consultations (évaluation Action Contre la Faim & Concern Word Wide, 2017). Ce même rapport dénote des insuffisances dans les connaissances basiques et pratiques en matières d’hygiène et d’assainissement et ceci constitue une préoccupation majeure dans les endroits publics, les rues et les habitations de toute la région. 56,6% des personnes sur l’axe Ngouboua-Tchoukoutalia révèlent des symptômes de stress post traumatiques. Les conditions de leurs déplacements forcés ont été plus dramatiques (agressions, vol, pillages, exécutions, incendies de villages, accouchement dans des conditions précaires viols ). Selon l’enquête sur la protection menée par Oxfam en Mars 2017, la présence des militaires constituerait également une menace particulièrement pour les populations hôtes et 15% des personnes provenant des communautés hôtes plus particulièrement à Bagasola, Daboua et Kiskawa l’auraient confirmé où de nombreuses femmes ont témoigné ne plus oser sortir de chez elles ou se rendre au marché. Le projet de Santé Mentale implémenté de janvier à mai 2017 par ACF dans le district de Liwa a fait ressortir des besoins criants en prise en charge de cas de traumatisme en général. 65,3% des personnes enquêtées affirment qu’un membre de leurs familles manifeste de signes d’anxiété et 77,9% de tristesse suite aux exactions des groupes armés et surtout d’abandonner leurs activités sur les îles . Les violences basées sur le genre (VBG) sont aussi critiques dans la région du lac : de janvier à septembre 2017, 1428 cas de violences ont été enregistrés et les violences sexuelles constituent 22% de ces cas.

52598,2018,"1200000",5684,"Tchad Plan de Réponse Humanitaire 2018","Nutrition","8501","Action Contre la Faim - France","Needs","L’enquête nutritionnelle SMART menée en 2017 montre que la prévalence de la malnutrition aigüe globale (MAG) est largement au-dessus du seuil d'urgence de 15% dans cette région  et elle est en augmentation comparativement à l’année dernière . La MAG est estimée à 21,3% [17,2 - 26,1] contre 16,1% [13,3-19,4] en 2016. Quant à la MAS elle est passée de 2,3% [1,4-3,9] en 2016  à 4,7% [2,8 - 7,6] en 2017. Cette  enquête montre que 42,2% [36,9 - 47,6]d’enfants de moins de 59mois  souffrent de la malnutrition chronique en 2017, contre 25,4% [21,5-29,8] en 2016. Ces résultats ont permis au cluster Nutrition de placer le BEG parmi les 15 régions plus prioritaires nécessitant une réponse d’urgence en nutrition. 
Selon la Délégation Régionale de la Santé du BEG, la malnutrition reste l’une des causes majeures de la mortalité dans la région, du fait des problèmes d’accès aux soins. De plus, malgré le nombre de centres de santé dont dispose la région, la mobilité de la population (45% de nomades) rend difficile l’accès aux soins.
Par ailleurs, le plan régional du développement sanitaire du Bahr El Gazal  2017 montre que la malnutrition aiguë est la première cause de morbidité (30%) dans les centres de santé, suivi du paludisme (20%), des maladies diarrhéiques (14%) et des infections respiratoires aigües (13%) qui affectent majoritairement les enfants. Cette classification n’a pas évolué, la malnutrition demeurant une première cause de consultation. L’origine multiple et complexe des causes de la malnutrition comme décrit dans le cadre conceptuel de la malnutrition est mis en évidence dans cette région. En effet au-delà de l’impact de l’insécurité alimentaire sur la malnutrition, le rôle important joué par l’insuffisance d’hygiène et d’assainissement, le manque d’accès aux services de santé entrainent, notamment pendant les périodes de pic de morbidité excessive, une dégradation du statut nutritionnel de l’enfant.
Il est à noter que deux tiers de la population vivent à plus de 5 km d’un centre de santé ; loin des recommandations de l’OMS, le BEG compte 1 médecin pour 48760 pour habitants, 1IDE pour 9225 habitants et 1Sage femme pour 18465 femmes en âge de procréer. Ces chiffres sont loins des recommandations de l’OMS (1 médecin pour 10 000 hab ;IDE/ 5000 habitants). Le manque de ressources matérielles, humaines et financières ne permettent pas aux autorités sanitaires d’assurer leur fonction de supervision des structures de santé et d’investigation d’évènements sanitaires type épidémie. 
Dans le domaine de l'eau, hygiène et assainissement,80% des centres de santé des 3 districts possèdent des points d’eau mais plus de 90% d’entre eux manquent d’infrastructures d’assainissement et hygiène. La gestion des déchets médicaux présente des lacunes importantes, particulièrement l'absence de système de gestion des ordures courantes (bac à ordures) .
Par ailleurs, les rapports sociaux entre les sexes et la perception que les femmes et hommes ont leurs rôles respectifs expliquent les pratiques inégalitaires au sein des ménages et des communautés de la région du BEG . Pourtant, les femmes jouent un rôle très important dans la communauté mais elles ont un accès et un contrôle très limités aux ressources générées grâce à leur contribution. Les mariages forcés et précoces, l’insuffisance de la scolarisation des jeunes filles, les inégalités liées au genre, etc., sont autant d’obstacles à l’émancipation des femmes. Dans ce projet , ACF intègrera la dimension genre à chaque étape de son programme, pour les bénéficiaires directs, indirects et équipes ACF, afin de répondre de façon adaptée aux besoins de l’ensemble de la population. Les données seront analysées par genre et par catégorie d’âge, puis utilisée au besoin pour réajuster le programme. Les bénéficiaires de ce projet sont en majorité des enfants <5 ans, qui sont les plus vulnérables et leurs accompagnantes, les femmes enceintes et allaitantes, les femmes en âges de procréer.

N.B : ACTED Tchad a mis en place un mécanisme de feedbacks et de plaintes centralisé au niveau de la coordination du pays et couvrant l’ensemble de ses projets. Ce mécanisme est géré de manière confidentielle par un staff indépendant en capitale. Les plaintes peuvent être communiquées au moyen d’une ligne verte, d’une adresse email et de boîtes à plaintes sur les sites de projet. L’ensemble des plaintes sont adressées dans un délai de 15 jours par la coordination selon les degrés de gravité. Ce mécanisme est présenté en amont des activités de chaque projet aux équipes de mise en œuvre, qui se sont engagés à respecter un code de conduite, ainsi qu’aux bénéficiaires à travers divers moyens de communication.
ACTED privilégie une approche participative à chaque étape de la mise en œuvre du cycle du projet, en particulier lors des évaluations de besoins et de la sélection des bénéficiaires à travers la consultation des différentes parties prenantes. Ceci afin d’assurer une approche inclusive de l’ensemble des bénéficiaires et notamment des populations les vulnérables (femmes, personnes malades, handicapées et/ou personnes âgées).  Au sein de la mission ACTED Tchad, une équipe d’évaluation et de suivi indépendante est formée à cette approche."

En raison d'une réduction des acteurs et bailleurs humanitaires dans la zone depuis 2016, les standards minimums de plusieurs secteurs (santé, EHA, abris, sécurité alimentaire, protection) se sont progressivement détériorés,  rendant les communautés retournées, les femmes et les enfants tout particulièrement, très vulnérables. L'accès aux services sociaux de base reste un défi majeur et la couverture d'accès aux services d'hygiène et assainissement est très basse tant dans les sites (30%) que dans les villages d'accueil (15%) pour les retournés. De plus, les abris d'urgence construits en 2014 n'offrent plus les conditions de logement décent et de nombreux abris sont régulièrement détruits par les vents ou les pluies violents dans les sites de Djako, Kobiteye, Sido et Maingama. Par ailleurs, la plupart des retournés dans les sites souffrent d'une insécurité alimentaire modérée (48%) ou sévère (6%). Pour couvrir leurs besoins alimentaires, certains retournés ont recours à des stratégies de survie néfastes (vente de biens, retrait des enfants de l'école, etc.). Depuis le début de l'année 2017, plusieurs centaines de retournés se seraient déplacées vers des camps de réfugiés dans l'espoir de recevoir une assistance humanitaire, bien ques les réfugiés soient eux-mêmes confrontés à une diminution des rations alimentaires.
A ces besoins s’additionne le manque d’opportunités économiques et de moyens de subsistance pour des populations à majorité d'origine urbaine. Ces besoins ont été exacerbés après les destructions engendrées par les inondations de 2017.
Enfin le manque de délivrance de papier d'identité reste un problème majeur pour l'intégration économique et sociale de ces retournés, faute de mise en oeuvre et de financement du plan de réinsertion des retournés du gouvernement. Un plaidoyer et un accompagnement des retournés pour cet accès à des documents d'identité est donc primordial afin de garantir leur intégration durable, au regard des faibles intentions de retour vers la RCA."

52842,2018,"900000",5684,"Tchad Plan de Réponse Humanitaire 2018","Nutrition","4303","International Medical Corps US","Needs","According to the draft Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) 2018 and l’ Analyse du Cadre Harmonisé, (section: personnes en phase 4 d’urgence alimentaire, March 2017), nearly 900,000 people in 12 of Chad’s 23 regions are food insecure, and the situation is most severe in the regions of Lake (12,000 people), Guera (83,000 people), Wadi Fira (7,000 people) and Ouaddai (10,000 people). Food insecurity in these and other regions contributes to the prevalence of malnutrition above emergency thresholds. As measured through the national SMART survey conducted between July and August 2017 by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and UNICEF, national Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) prevalence is 13.9%, with national Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) prevalence at 3.9%. Ouaddai Region is one of the 15 regions in Chad where either or both regional GAM or SAM levels exceed emergency thresholds (GAM > 15%, SAM > 2%). According to SMART 2017 results, in Ouaddai Region, the rate of SAM was 2.7% with a GAM rate of 14.2%, which has been also confirmed by the results of a mass screening conducted by IMC specifically for Abdi District in May 2017. 

Between September 2015 and January 2016, International Medical Corps (IMC) led an initiative funded by OFDA to conduct a Link Nutrition Causal Analysis (NCA) study in Abdi District of Ouaddai Region . The process is a multisectoral, mixed-method approach which seeks to create a consensus around the possible causes of under-nutrition in a local context. The Link NCA study in Abdi District identified a major factor that contributed to child malnutrition in the area as the high prevalence of child illness caused by elevated risk of infection due to inadequate safe water, sanitation and hygiene, and aggravated by a weak health system and the preference for traditional medicine. Child malnutrition was also strongly linked to household food insecurity caused by dependence on low agricultural production that does not cover all family needs, and the high workload of mothers who do not adopt optimal practices for infant and young child feeding, and health care seeking. 

In recognition of the integral link between household practices and the development and exacerbation of malnutrition, IMC also conducted an Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) study for Abdi District in November 2016. This study estimated the prevalence of optimal IYCF practices, following a small-sample methodology developed by several institutions and organizations . Study results found that only 21.5% of children aged between 0 and 23 months received optimal IYCF . In addition, only 23.9% of mothers said they had received information on IYCF topics over the last months. 

Chad is also affected by a severe health crisis affecting local and displaced populations, especially women and children as stated in 2017 and 2018 HRPs. Based on a reeds assessment carried out in supported health facilities in Abdi region in November 2016, outstanding needs related to human resources were identified. Specifically, 11 health centers did not have midwives, and one health center did not have a nurse or a midwife; 4 health centers had only one clinical care provider. 

Between April and September 2017, the primary health care utilization rate in Abdi District was calculated as 0.23 new outpatient consultations per person per year. While coverage for first antenatal consultations (ANC1) during the same time period was high (100% of expected pregnant women), coverage for subsequent ANC visits was lower (ANC2 73%, ANC3 43%, ANC4 20% ), and coverage for skilled birth attendance was 20%. During the period between July and September 2017, 31% of new consultations were for children Under 5, and new consultations were 43% male and 57% female. Substantial demand generation work remains to be done in Abdi District to motivate the population to seek care at health centers, for both curative consultations and reproductive health care.

Le projet prend en compte la protection transversale de la manière suivante : 
•	Données désagrégées par sexe sur la communauté affectée.
•	Élaboration d’une stratégie de mitigation des risques.
•	Travaux de rénovation pour garantir la sécurité des bénéficiaires (éclairage, latrines homme/femmes, embauche de gardiens).
•	Dignité des bénéficiaires : kit d’admission pour l’hospitalisation et 3 repas par jour pour l’accompagnant en fonction du régime alimentaire local. 
•	Services de prise en charge gratuit et accessible, répondant aux besoins exprimés par la communauté.
•	Services dans les zones où ces services font défaut.
•	Accessibilité non discriminatoire basée sur l’état de santé.
•	Accessibilité facilité par un système de référencement.
•	Les communautés affectées sont associées étroitement à la mise en œuvre du projet (relais communautaires, accoucheuses traditionnelles formées, mères sensibilisées au PB mère).
•	Activités de communication sur les services fournis (la diffusion d’émissions télévisuelles et radiophonique, sensibilisation des relais communautaires).

Or la malnutrition affaibli conséquemment l’état de santé des enfants et les expose d’avantage à des pathologies comme le paludisme, les IRA et diarrhées. ALIMA/AS étant une des seules ONG à prendre en charge la MAS à N’Djamena, elle souhaite continuer ses activités en 2018, tout en renforçant la collaboration avec les autorités sanitaires et pays et les structures hospitalières publiques lui référençant de nombreux cas de MAS avec complications.

La Région du Lac Tchad affiche également des taux de malnutrition aigüe sévère élevés: 3.4% selon la synthèse de l’enquête SMART 2017. ALIMA/AS travaillant depuis 2012 à Ngouri, a choisi d’adopter un paquet de soins plus complet avec de la prise en charge de la MAS, de prendre en charge les cas pédiatriques en ambulatoire et en hospitalier, ainsi que la santé maternelle. Le volet WASH continuera à être mis en œuvre pour l’année 2018 en raison des liens démontrés entre la malnutrition et l’eau et l’assainissement. 
Enfin un plan de contingence est ici nécessaire pour l’année 2018 en raison du risque de propagation de la crise humanitaire que subissent actuellement les villes situées sur le Lac Tchad.

52813,2018,"22885530",5684,"Tchad Plan de Réponse Humanitaire 2018","Nutrition","2915","United Nations Children's Fund","Needs","In Chad, according to the 2014 -2015 Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey (MICS), infant and child mortality rates are very high with 65 and 133 deaths %o live births respectively; and the maternal mortality rate is also unacceptably high at 860 deaths per 100,000 live births. One out of every 6 children die before 5 years old. The main direct causes of mortality in under-five children in Chad are preventable: malaria (20.4%), pneumonia (15.7%) and diarrhea (13.5%) are the top causes, while malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies and poor child care such as sub-optimal infant feeding practices contribute to at least a third of these deaths.
The country faces different forms of malnutrition that compromises lives of thousands of people. This situation results from the combination of several factors, including: (i) low food availability due to poor performance of production systems; (ii) low accessibility of populations to foodstuffs because of high prices and monetary poverty; (iii) unbalanced diet; (iv) inadequate infants and young child feeding practices; poor exclusive breastfeeding practices ; (v) Inadequate access to drinking water; (vi) persistence of traditional beliefs and low level of education of vulnerable people; (vii) Poor quality of health care; (viii) low coverage of basic social services and (xi) poor hygiene and sanitation conditions of an important segment of the population.
Regions in the sahel belt are most affected by food insecurity, which is an open door to malnutrition in all its forms. According to the results of the 2017 National Nutrition Survey, there is a deterioration of the nutritional state with a global acute malnutrition rate increasing from 11.9% in 2016 to 13.9% in 2017 which represents a serious situation. In addition, severe acute malnutrition rate is estimated at 3.9% compared to 2.6% in 2016. Most regions of the Sahel belt exceed the critical threshold set by WHO.
Beyond the food and nutrition crisis that hampers the life of thousands of children, Chad has been hosting more refugees than any other countries in the region that continue to put an additional strain on the already overstretch resources. In addition, there is a recurrence of cholera, measles and hepatitis outbreaks in the region. Children under five, pregnant and lactating women are the most vulnerable. 
In view of this alarming situation, coordinated actions are needed to improve the nutritional and health status of populations in need in those regions through expansion and strengthening of health services to manage malnutrition, increasing health promotion and good nutritional practices for women and children."

N.B : ACTED Tchad a mis en place un mécanisme de feedbacks et de plaintes centralisé au niveau de la coordination du pays et couvrant l’ensemble de ses projets. Ce mécanisme est géré de manière confidentielle par un staff indépendant en capitale. Les plaintes peuvent être communiquées au moyen d’une ligne verte, d’une adresse email et de boîtes à plaintes sur les sites de projet. L’ensemble des plaintes sont adressées dans un délai de 15 jours par la coordination selon les degrés de gravité. Ce mécanisme est présenté en amont des activités de chaque projet aux équipes de mise en œuvre, qui se sont engagés à respecter un code de conduite, ainsi qu’aux bénéficiaires à travers divers moyens de communication.

ACTED privilégie une approche participative à chaque étape de la mise en œuvre du cycle du projet, en particulier lors des évaluations de besoins et de la sélection des bénéficiaires à travers la consultation des différentes parties prenantes. Ceci afin d’assurer une approche inclusive de l’ensemble des bénéficiaires et notamment des populations les vulnérables (femmes, personnes malades, handicapées et/ou personnes âgées).  Au sein de la mission ACTED Tchad, une équipe d’évaluation et de suivi indépendante est formée à cette approche."
52712,2018,"2541530",5684,"Tchad Plan de Réponse Humanitaire 2018","Food Security","2886","Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development","Needs","Selon le HNO 2017, sur la population totale du Tchad s'élevant à 14,2 millions de personnes, il a été estimé que 4,7 millions de personnes sont dans le besoin, dont 4,3 millions souffrant d'insécurité alimentaire. L'insécurité alimentaire est plus marquée dans les régions de la bande sahélienne, notamment dans la région du Batha (47% d'insécurité alimentaire global et 21,7% dans la région du Lac). Cette insécurité est notamment due à un manque de résilience des populations locales et à une forte vulnérabilité au changement climatique et à ses impacts sur les moyens de subsistance qui pourrait être atténuer par l'existence d'un système d'alertes précoces efficace. En effet, dans les deux régions, la saison agricole 2017 a été pire que l'année précédente (récoltes plus faibles, pluies irrégulières, attaques de granivores, faible crue,....) ce qui aura un impact sur les moyens d'existence des populations et risquera d'entrainer une soudure précoce en 2018. par ailleurs, le Batha a également été déclaré en crise pastorale en 2017.

Par ailleurs, la malnutrition est également très marquée au Tchad. En effet, selon le HNO 2017, elle touche 1,5 million de personnes, dont 402 000 enfants considérés comme étant malnutris. L'enquête SMART de 2017 vient confirmer ces chiffres puisqu'elle indique que la prévalence de malnutrition globale (MAG) est au-dessus du seuil d'alerte de l'OMS fixé à 10% puisqu'elle s'élève à 22,1%, et touche principalement les enfants. De plus, la prévalence de la Malnutrition Aiguë Sévère (MAS) est également au-dessus du seuil d'alerte fixé à 2% par l'OMS, puisqu'elle s'élève en 2016 à 4,1%. 
Plus précisément, la région du Batha et la région du Lac sont sévèrement frappées par la malnutrition. Elles font en effet partie des six régions du Tchad parmi lesquelles la prévalence de la MAG dépasse le seuil d'urgence fixé par l'OMS avec des taux respectivement dede 16,6% en 2016 à 22,1% en 2017 pour le Batha et de 12,2% en 2016 à 18,1% en 2017 pour la région du Lac; plaçant ces régions dans une situation sérieuse. S'agissant de la MAS au niveau régional, il a été constaté que onze régions ont un seuil d'urgence de plus de 2% dont le Batha et le Lac, faisant d'elles des régions en situation d'urgence nutritionnelle.

Since mid-2014, fighting has spread and intensified across Libya, leading to civilian casualties, damage to civilian infrastructure and displacement. In the last 12 months, ongoing conflict in populated areas has directly affected an estimated 1.62 million Libyans, of whom 378,000 are children, according to the latest UN and partners needs analysis. As of August 2017, there were still around 217,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs), while some 278,000 people returned to their places of origin. Libya continues to be the main transit point of departure for people attempting the Mediterranean crossing to Europe.  At least 2,783 people have died in the attempt to cross in 2017 to date. Arrivals report exploitation, abuse, sexual violence, unlawful killings and torture in Libya by armed groups, including those affiliated to State institutions. They have no or limited access to services and live in fear of capture and arbitrary detention. Libya is also a destination country for migrants on temporary economic and circular migration routes from neighboring and West African countries. It therefore hosts large populations of migrants who have integrated with their local communities over time, with some sharing familial ties or social networks. Over 400,000 migrants/refugees/asylum seekers in Libya are particularly exposed to abuse and human rights violations as proliferating rent-seeking armed groups engage in smuggling and exploitation.  
Recent developments have provided some momentum to a stalled political process, but with no clear solutions as yet the country remains divided between rival administrations, leaving national and local institutions largely unable to provide protection and basic services. The economic situation continues to deteriorate, deepening vulnerabilities. Living conditions have deteriorated as availability of affordable food, fuel, water, electricity and medical supplies decreases and the provision of health care and public services declines. Weak rule of law is leaving vulnerable civilians and marginalized groups unprotected. 
As a result of these patterns, the international community continues to scale up its interventions in Libya, and humanitarian actors are developing a more varied humanitarian response, which includes rapid and emergency response capacity, multi-sectoral approaches to support vulnerable households, and support to restore basic functionality of essential services at the community level.  As a consequence, the international community needs to deliver a rapid and well-coordinated response at scale - one that is centred on the immediate needs of vulnerable people and communities. For OCHA, the imperative is to focus on a strengthened Libya-based coordination to improve the timeliness, scale and quality of the response. Since the establishment of a Country Office in early 2017, OCHA has worked on reinforcing the existing coordination structures, adapting them to the context, while also increasing the inclusion and engagement of Libyan actors. This requires sustained investment in engagement with a wide range of partners at the central and local level in Libya."

OCHA Libya will support the transition and/or setting up of inclusive coordination structures in Libya, with the main coordination structures based in Tripoli, and area coordination structures, as appropriate, in priority locations for humanitarian actors (including but not limited to Benghazi and Sabha, with back-up structures based in Tunis). OCHA will support the HCT to serve as a highest strategic, policy-level and decision-making forum that guides principled humanitarian action as agreed in the Humanitarian Response Plan. OCHA Libya will strengthen the role that NGOs will play in humanitarian operations and coordination, including through supporting the INGO forum and

SO2: Strengthen capacity to deliver more credible, comprehensive and evidence-based situational analysis;
OCHA Libya will systematically produce granular and conflict-sensitive context analysis on the humanitarian context in Libya, including the access and humanitarian space situation, which is closely linked with stabilization, development and peacebuilding analysis, to come to a common understanding of the Libya situation. OCHA Libya will support and coordinate inter-sector assessments, produce regular and ad hoc information products, including 4W maps, Flash Updates, and Dashboards, to provide analysis on needs, capacity, financial coverage, gaps, and trends. 

SO3: Drive collective action and innovation in sourcing and delivering efficient financing for humanitarian action that is sufficient, timely and coordinated to meet the needs of crisis-affected people;
OCHA Libya will advocate for the provision of adequate and predictable funding to humanitarian activities, including those in the HRP and for unforeseen emergencies. This includes efforts to increase direct funding to national partners. OCHA will also support a better understanding of the various funding streams coming towards Libya and how they can be best leveraged to contribute positively to humanitarian activities.

S0 4: Drive international acceptance of the centrality of international humanitarian and human rights law, access and protection that results in meaningful action for affected people, especially IDPs;
OCHA Libya will seek to ensure that awareness and advocacy of humanitarian principles is increased and a more accountable humanitarian response is developed through increased community inclusion, systematic advocacy, reporting and increased accountability on IHL and human rights violations, as well as better integration of the do no harm approach. OCHA will support the development and implementation of a community engagement strategy of the HCT, as well as an access strategy.

SO5: People leadership to drive transformative change in the humanitarian system.
OCHA will support humanitarian operations in transitioning from reactive approach to a preparedness approach and a more flexible response. OCHA will also support and advocate of better linkages of humanitarian coordination structures with stabilization and development coordination mechanisms, through increased engagement with local and central authorities and regular interactions with donors on thematic and region-specific topics to ensure predictable and complementary interventions (and subsequent funding) in Libya."

OCHA will support the development and implementation of a community engagement strategy of the HCT, as well as an access strategy should the HCT decide these be necessary in the upcoming year. The HC is accountable and responsible for ensuring an effective, coherent and realistic response to the protection and humanitarian assistance needs of affected populations, particularly IDPs, including through advocacy and resource mobilization. It is the primary role of OCHA to support the HC in meeting these responsibilities. In addition, OCHA supports the HC to ensure that cross-cutting protection concerns, are adequately reflected and addressed in the work of all clusters through its inter-cluster coordination role.
More specifically OCHA advocates for and works with the HC/HCT, in close collaboration with the protection sector, to ensure that core protection priorities are incorporated within Humanitarian Needs Overviews and Humanitarian Response Plans and broader advocacy efforts by the HC or the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC). OCHA also supports the HC to ensure a comprehensive response to internal displacement and complementary actions by partners. OCHA also supports the protection sector to fulfill its sector responsibilities, to build synergies with other key actors and to mobilise adequate resources for protection activities and will also ask for advice and guidance from the Protection sector to fulfil OCHAs responsibilities. OCHA also supports the HC, in collaboration with the protection sector, to ensure that overall needs are identified and addressed across sectors through inter-sector coordination; and lastly OCHA ensures protection sector inputs into high level fora and mechanisms, such as relevant Secretary-General country-specific and thematic reports and statements of the Secretary General or the ERC.

These include INGOs, NNGOs, UN Agencies and authorities or community representative committees who wish to contribute to a coherent and prioritized response to humanitarian needs in Libya.
Built around effective community engagement, part of OCHA’s work is to integrate AAP components into the Humanitarian Programme Cycle as well as within the inter-sector coordination mechanism. Thus, in order to demonstrate the humanitarian leadership’s commitment to AAP and to facilitate its integration, OCHA will support in ensuring that the HCT and ICSG include frequent agenda items on AAP within the various coordination platforms/meetings. Furthermore, OCHA will actively seek the views of its target group (the humanitarian community and their partners) in order to improve on policy and practice in coordination mechanisms, and ensure that feedback and complaints are incorporated. OCHA will also ensure that affected populations are better integrated in needs assessment and analysis and that all projects submitted under the HRP present evidence of AAP and that response is based on affected population’s needs and priorities. Furthermore, ensuring that affected communities have accurate and timely information enables their meaningful participation in humanitarian response. OCHA will thus support by identifying information, communication and accountability gaps. OCHA will also support sectors and operational agencies to ensure two-way communication or feedback mechanism (including the use of media), contextualising accountability frameworks and supporting participatory approaches for the affected populations. OCHA will endeavour to strengthen capacities of humanitarian organisation undertaking various levels of community engagement by facilitating partnerships in emergency response preparedness and emergency response should there be a need.

This region is one of the most vulnerable within Chad due to accessibility challenges, the lack of basic social services and the high frequency of natural and environmental hazards, which include floods and droughts. 

Chronic food insecurity, poor access to quality health care, low vaccination coverage, inadequate nutrition education and practices on Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) and chronic poverty are factors fueling high malnutrition rates in the Lake Region. These factors are exacerbated by the level of insecurity as the result of violence instigated by Boko Haram militants in the area, which has resulted in the widespread disruption of community structures and massive population displacements.

The national SMART survey conducted in August 2017 indicted the prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM) as 18.1% and the SAM prevalence as 3.4% in the Lake Region. The national average was 13.9% and 3.9% for GAM and SAM, respectively

This steering group will initiate the action oriented research, agree on the interventions and oversees the implementation. 2) the interventions will also be closely monitored and supported by the higher commission for the returnees, the red crescent, the scouts,   and the UNFPA Y-Peer network in Sirt. 3). At the UN level, each component will be monitored through relevant sector meetings including protection, health and education.
UNFPA will be responsible for the coordination and smooth implementation of the overall intervention, monitoring and reporting. The Project will be coordinated through a Steering Committee which will provide high-level direction, support, and oversight to development, review, and implementation of the action to ensure the efficiency, and coherence of the Action in helping to achieve its overall impact.

The project will be monitored through visits by the national coordinator, the systematic collection of data on specific indicators and progress will be reported in the narrative report. 
UNFPA will produce one consolidated report by the end of the project life time, including the narrative and the financial parts.

As for coordinating with other agencies, namely UNICEF and IOM, the project complement their interventions as it focuses on protecting from violence in all its forms, it also focuses only in Sirte and only on young people 15-29 years. Therefore, it would complement the activities of UNICEF projects and build on the capacity of services providers trained by UNICEF in the education sector and would also go beyond the children's focus of UNICEF. As for the complementarity with IOM, UNFPA project will capitalize on the protective environment and on the health system revitalized by IOM in Sirte.

52344,2018,"3000000",5683,"Libya Humanitarian Response Plan 2018","Health","3001","International Rescue Committee","Needs","Overall in Libya, an estimated 1.1 million Libyan and non-Libyan individuals are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance according to the Humanitarian Needs Overview 2018 (HNO).  In particular, 1,056,000 individuals are reported to be in need of health assistance including 380,000 non-displaced Libyans, 190,000 returnees, 308,500 mixed migrants and 177,500 internaly displaced persons (IDPs). In addition, a total of 1,047,500 individuals are reported to be in need of protection assistance including 334,000 non-displaced Libyans, 187,500 returnees, 400,445 mixed migrants and 125,500 IDPs.
The Humanitarian Response Plan 2018 (HRP) identified both health and protection as priority sectors. Ongoing conflicts between multiple groups vying for power have increased needs and impacted humanitarian access. Challenges in terms of humanitarian access and security have impacted the international community’s ability to provide emergency services. Nonetheless, as of September 2017, the HRP 2017 was only 55% funded (Health and protection sectors were only funded at 20% and 10%) and funding for Libya has remained somehow challenging. Few international organisations including the IRC have been able to directly implement activities. 
Findings of the recent Libya Service Availability and Readiness Assessment  and Multi-sector needs assessment   confirmed that a substantial number of health facilities are either partially operational or closed and are facing a critical lack of medicines and staffing shortages, particularly for reproductive and mental health. The readiness level of facilities to provide essential RH services is 39% and only 2% of the primary health care centres (PHCCs) in the Western region are offering family planning services. Availability of Mental Health services is very low with only seven facilities across the Western region offering these services, noting that prior to the conflict, the health system placed very little emphasis on community based mental health and psychosocial support yet 3.3% of the households (HHs) assessed reported at least one member medically diagnosed with a mental illness.
Overall, both vulnerable Libyan and non-Libyan individuals face barriers while accessing primary healthcare due to insufficient financial means, stigma and limited knowledge of available services. In particular, 44% of HHs assessed and who reported to have needed healthcare, did not get access to adequate healthcare in the last 15 days due to reasons outlined above and lack of medical staff and supplies. Discrimination and threat to physical and legal safety are also reported to restrain access of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers to health services. 
Meanwhile, a widespread protection crisis is affecting the country. Armed conflict and lack of rule of law has resulted in increased violence and discrimination against women and  children who face multiple layers of discrimination and abuses. Cross-border human trafficking is also increasing with forced labor and sexual exploitation of trafficked victims. Refugees and migrants are also at high risk, reportedly being subjected to physical and mental abuse, forced labor, financial exploitation, arbitrary arrest and detention. Overall,  the three main theats related to personnal safety highlighted in the HNO 2018 are presence of threatening behaviours,  assaults and kidnappings.

The IRC participates in Health and Protection sectors meetings during which the organisation shares and discuss projects updates, assessments findings and any relevant information with other international and local organisations. The IRC also attends the Health Cluster coordination meeting in Tripoli, organized by the Ministry of Health. The IRC is also a member of the Mixed Migration Working Group which aims to ensure effective coordination of protection and assistance to migrants and refugees in Libya. The IRC is an active member of the INGO Forum and a member of the Humanitarian Country Group.
In Libya, the IRC maintains regular communication with health authorities including the Ministry of Health in Tripoli, the International Cooperation under MoH, and the Department of Health (DoH) of Misrata and DoH Sirte. The IRC works in close collaboration with the representatives of DoH in particular for the identification of intervention sites and the support within health facilities. The IRC has signed an MoU with MoH covering all its activities across Libya.   
The IRC has completed all registration requirements under the Civil Society Commission and has a legal registration to operate in Libya.

The IRC is doing direct implementation of all its activities and does not have any implementing partners. However, the IRC will work in close coordination with MoH, DoH, and directors of primary health clinics. There is no contractual and financial commitment between the IRC and MoH, however the IRC has already signed MoUs with MoH in Tripoli, DoH in Misrata and DoH in Sirte. Health officials are included in the design of health activities and provide support with the identification of areas with the highest needs. The IRC is regularly meeting with the International Cooperation within the MoH, attending health WG meetings in Tunis and attending health meetings in Tripoli. 

The IRC is committed to the effective monitoring of its program implementation. At the start of the program, a grants opening  meeting will be  held  to  ensure  a  common understanding of the project’s activities, approach, the support  needed  from  different  departments, reporting  and data  collection  requirements,  and  expected impact.  The IRC will utilize a performance Monitoring Plan to track progress towards output targets over the timeline of the program. MHT will collect output-level data during program implementation on a weekly and monthly basis. The Health Coordinator will monitor progress towards the achievement of output targets. 
Staff will provide mission  reports  detailing  activities  implemented  and  the  number  and  types  of beneficiaries reached. An analysis and summary of the mission reports will be reviewed on a regular basis by the relevant coordination bodies and senior management.  The number of elderly persons, female heads-of-household, children and physically disabled individuals assisted will also be tracked. The IRC does not plan to conduct a formal protection baseline survey as it would not be appropriate or ethical to conduct a detailed survey of human rights violations, incidents of GBV and victims’ or survivors’ experiences prior to the intervention. The IRC’s experience will allow program staff to assess whether the rates of rights violations they are observing in  the  target  groups are  lower  than  expected,  typical  or  higher  than  expected. During the project, the IRC will conduct quality of care evaluations, gathering qualitative and quantitative data in order to look at project outcomes, lessons learned, and make recommendations for improvements for future project interventions.

IRC Libya will give special emphasis to women and girls, to ensure that services are accessible, equitable, and meet their specific needs. Specific attention will be given to a reduction in risks associated with GBV, psychosocial support and referrals. 
IRC's programs are client centric, enabling its clients to provide feedback to IRC in a confidential way, through our feedback mechanism. IRC's services will be customized based on the needs of its clients and address all feedback in a confidential manner.

The IRC will ensure access to protection services for the affected population either through referral to IRC's protection caseworkers, and/or referral to other protection INGOs. IRC will continue using healthcare as an entry point to locations where populations have protection concerns. 
Moreover, as conflict and displacement have increased the risks of gender-based violence in Libya especially with respect to sexual violence, domestic violence, and trafficking as a means of meeting basic needs. High levels of stigma, conservative community values, and insecurity pose serious barriers to the reporting of violence. To address the existing needs in its current and upcoming programs the IRC has recently started and will continue to expand programming for women and girls including:
-	Ensuring women and girls are able to access free, quality and life-saving care, IRC hires case workers for its mobile health teams who work with community health mobilisers to inform women and girls about services available, monitor protection concerns and make referrals to specific services when needed. 
-	As a crosscutting theme, IRC will support gender mainstreaming through all sector interventions within IRC Libya.
-       Outreach activities related to SGBV issues (services available, importance of reaching out services in the required time frame).
-	Mental health and  Psychological support services will be provided.
-       PEP kits will be donated to supported health facilities.

IRC’s integrated health and protection model includes caseworkers embedded with the mobile health teams. Through reproductive healthcare, the medical team is able to identify and refer potential cases to the social workers who then follow up with case management. The caseworkers are currently in process of recruitment and training on GBV, including the following topics: GBV core concepts training; GBV/WPE case management; Safe spaces/mobile service delivery modalities and do’s/don’ts; GBV referral pathways; GBV Prevention and PSS. 
IRC is currently in the process of conducting a GBV referral mapping in Misrata and Sirte, where very few protection partners are working. Also, IRC is currently doing a service mapping to identify safe spaces/clinics for the clinical referral of rape. Moreover, through coordination with other actors in Misrata and Sirte, the IRC will work to establish a referral mechanism between health and protection actors operating in the area. In contrast, such coordination meetings and referral pathways are well established in Tripoli. The IRC will make sure to feed into existing coordination systems, already in place in both Tripoli and Tunis.

IRC's Mobile Health Teams (MHTs) will be deployed in areas with low health coverage. Depending of the needs assessed and the space available, MHTs will be working either in existing understaffed primary healthcare centers, within community centers or within detention or transit centers. The proposed approach, integrating MHPSS and RH within primary healthcare and utilising MHTs’ strategy will reduce access barrier linked to stigma and will ensure the flexibility required to access in a fast and effective manner to hard to reach populations with protection needs.  
IRC's MHTs will be comprised of a general practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, gynecologists psycho-social workers and community health workers (CHWs). MHTs, stocked with lifesaving  drugs, will provide primary healthcare services to patients. MHTs will map second and third level health facilities to set up referral pathways and identify facilities where patients in need of specialized care can receive quality care without discrimination. Referral pathways will be set up with public and private health facilities of the second and third levels, and IRC will cover the costs of urgent, lifesaving referrals. MHTs will also offer RH services including ante and post-natal consultations and family planning services. MHTs  will be trained in Mental Health Gap Action Programme as well as in gender and child-friendly approaches to enable them to identify MHPSS concerns and detect protection problems or risks, both at community and facility levels. Patients identified with protection and mental health concerns will be  referred to IRC’s psychosocial workers.The latter will build technical capacity in order to deal with women, children and men, adapting responses to their specific needs, including individual counselling and direct assistance, or referring them to other actors (including NGOs and CBOs) to receive appropriate assistance or services. Embedded in the MHTs, CHW (recruited from the supported communities) will carry out outreach activities at the community level. Outreach activities will inform vulnerable populations, including migrants of the protection risks, options and services available.These activities will also focus on enhancing host communities’ understanding of the issue of migration and foster an atmosphere of solidarity.
As a second pillar of our interventions, IRC’s programs will combine activities designed to increase access to health services through MHTs (servicing areas with low capacity for traditional service delivery) with activities designed to strengthen the quality of services available in existing health facilities (through provision of essential medical supplies and equipment, HIMS support and support to improve the technical and management capacities of health providers)."

(PUEBT) a confirmé que 74% de filles abandonnent l'école avant d'atteindre la classe de CEM pour
plusieurs raisons:mariage,grossesses précoces,manque d'intérêt chez les parents pour les faire étudier.
Le curriculum de l'éducation non formelle du Ministère de l'Education prévoit une formation des enfants
et jeunes scolarisés en activités productives. L'objectif de cette composante est de les familiariser aux
principaux métiers productifs et de les faire acquérir des compétences de base dans les différents
domaines ciblés. Dans le contexte du Lac, les femmes déplacées font face à des risques accrus dus au
déplacement des structures de protection et de soutien habituels. Parallèlement,ces dernières
rencontrent des contraintes d'accès aux services essentiels(santé, éducation)dues à l'insécurité,à la
réduction du rôle des femmes dans la société et à la limitation de leurs possibilités de déplacements. La
population,déjà très vulnérable socio économiquement en raison de faiblesses structurelles et de crises
chroniques alimentant son sous-développement,est sévèrement affectée par l'impact du conflit entre
l'Etat Islamique en Afrique de l'Ouest et les forces de la coalition des pays membres de la Commission
du bassin du Lac Tchad et du Bénin qui a engendré le déplacement de 130200 personnes depuis
2015.Les populations déplacées dans les départements de Mamdi, Kaya et Fouli sont sans
ressources,ce qui,combiné à l'arrêt des flux commerciaux depuis la fermeture de la frontière avec le
Nigéria,n'a fait qu'accroître la pression sur les populations locales. En décembre-16,l'insécurité
alimentaire affectait directement 41% de la population totale du Lac, le ratio médecin/habitant s'élève à
1 pour 53714(norme OMS:1 pour 10000).La population de la zone souffre également d'un accès à
l'eau(50%)et à l'hygiène(23%) insuffisant. Parmi les 30 sites enquêtés:2sites et 2villages ont un accés
limité à l'eau potable et 20villages et sites n'ont aucune latrine (Annexe 2).Le Gouvernement tchadien a
de plus décrété la mise en place de 16mesures d'austérité en septembre-16 prévoyant des réductions
drastiques dans les budgets publics affectant le secteur de l'éducation dans la région du Lac où le ratio
élève/enseignant est déjà inquiétant (1maître pour151élèves) et où l'accès aux services en termes
d'éducation et de protection est très faible. Le deuxième Recensement Général de la Population et de
l'Habitat de 2009 annonçait que,dans la région du Lac, le taux d'analphabétisme chez les plus de 15
ans atteignait 95,8%(moyenne nationale:80,7%)et que 89,4% des enfants de 6à14 ans n'allaient pas à
l'école(moyenne nationale:56,8%).Actuellement,seulement 9% des 65000enfants non scolarisés de la
région ont accès à l'éducation et l'année scolaire a démarré avec4mois de retard suite à une grève des
enseignants. La crise économique et les16mesures d'austérité affectent profondément le domaine de
l'éducation. De plus,le manque d'enseignants qualifiés dans les écoles de la région atteint un niveau
critique:30% des écoles primaires du Canton de Bol Rural (20 sur 65) étaient encore fermées en
décembre-16 faute d'enseignants ou de maîtres communautaires. Le secteur de l'éducation dépendant
des interventions humanitaires avec des maîtres communautaires actuellement rémunérés uniquement
par les acteurs de l'aide internationale,via le Global Partnership for Education (GPE).Cependant, les
activités d'éducation financées par le GPE via UNICEF ne permettent de couvrir qu'un quart des
besoins de la région. Les projets financés par ECHO et mis en place par COOPI et HI à partir d'avril-16
ont également confirmé le besoin important d'éducation et de soutien aux plus
vulnérables,particulièrement les enfants non accompagnés,les enfants seuls,les enfants handicapés et
les filles."

A survey was circulated through the UN agencies and the Ngos and almost 90% of the participants expressed their need for a humanitarian air service. This service will increase operational efficiency and effectiveness in the implementation and monitoring of humanitarian operations by providing a predictable access to priority destinations in order to enable humanitarian staff and donor representative to implement and monitor their projects. UNHAS can also provide medical and security evacuations."

Passenger and cargo bookings will be made through set systems to ensure the dissemination of flight schedules and manifests to all locations. A dedicated communication system will be put in place to monitor the progress of all flights through VHF/HF radios and a satellite tracking system. An electronic flight management application (E-FMA) that enables on-line booking requests by various agencies and monitoring of load factors, operational trends and costs is also part of the standards. There will be also a Performance Management Tool (PMT) that allows decision makers to automaticall collect and process data to carry out analysis of variations and trends and make informed decision on the optimization of the air operations. Under the authority of the WFP Country Director, The overall management, administration and control of the operation are vested in the Chief Air Transprt Officer (CATO) who reports directly to the Country Director and functionally to the chief of aviation service in Headquarters, Rome. The CATO will be responsible for all operational matters including scheduling, operator's compliance, safety management and risk management. The aviation service (OSLA) in Rome will be responsible for contracting of aircraft (Beachcraft b1900D 19 seats), quality assurance and normative guidance to the operation."

52446,2018,"800000",5683,"Libya Humanitarian Response Plan 2018","Multi-sector","4305","Mercy Corps","Needs","Libya has been in a state of turmoil since the overthrow of longtime leader Muammar Gadhafi in 2011. Conditions deteriorated significantly after a power struggle between rival political factions escalated in the summer of 2014; civil, security, and social services have since collapsed in many parts of the country. Libya is experiencing an economic crisis, characterized by a drop in GDP, the drastic depreciation of the Libyan dinar, a severe liquidity shortage and rapid inflation. Findings from assessments within IDPs and returnees, have shown that issues related to access basic needs are more related to the lack of cash, and the inflation, than to the availability of the supplies, and key commodities are no longer accessible or affordable to a large percentage of the Libyan population. Mercy Corps surveys showed that liquidity issues represent a main barrier to accessing services, and identified neighborhoods where families are struggling to cope with inflation and are confined into peripheral banlieue with extremely limited access to basic services and items."
52446,2018,"800000",5683,"Libya Humanitarian Response Plan 2018","Multi-sector","4305","Mercy Corps","How does your project address centrality of protection?","The humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, and strict adherence to a ""do no harm"" approach remain paramount. Practical steps to select financial service providers to minimise diversion of funds to the black market or terrorism are outlined. The decision on who to distribute to within the household referred for MPCT will take into account the gender and household dynamics. By providing for basic needs through MPCT, beneficiaries can choose to use freed up resources to meet their protection needs by choosing to acquire identity documents, or by freeing up more time for care providers of those with special needs."
52446,2018,"800000",5683,"Libya Humanitarian Response Plan 2018","Multi-sector","4305","Mercy Corps","How is your project accountable to the affected population?","Efforts are made to ensure community involvement at every possible stage of project planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Beneficiaries and local communities will also be involved during the implementation stages through access to a feedback mechanism and programme monitoring activities such as distribution monitoring, PDM and FGDs. Appropriate community accountability and reporting mechanisms will be tailored so that populations could measure the adequacy of the intervention, or address concerns and complaints. Mercy Corps will collect detailed information about each point of contact with the complaints telephone hotline, SMS system, or community complaints box. A feedback box will be available at every e-cards distribution site, and the programme team will ensure all support recipients are encouraged to share comments. 

Mercy Corps Accountability to Affected Population framework will be operationalized in the action through the following two existing and ongoing initiatives at Mercy Corps: 1.  Program Management at Mercy Corps (PM@MC) and 2. safe, confidential, transparent and accessible Community Accountability Reporting Mechanisms (CARMs). PM@MC is designed to be iterative, with the program lifecycle ‘planning’ components in a continuous loop with the implementation phase, allowing team members to be adaptive to stakeholder feedback. All team members share an obligation to prevent and respond to complaints, and focal points are primarily responsible for timely implementation and follow¬ up. Mercy Corps’ guidance strongly encourages team members to pay particular attention to potential stigma which could further victimize the survivors, including any repercussions they could face for reporting the incident."

Despite the existence of a plan, it was found that the most important gap for a timely response to rapid onset crises in Chad is the availability of contingency stock, prepositioned specifically to respond to Chad’s many recurrent emergencies. In a country with multiple and overlapping ongoing emergencies such as Chad, organizations mobilise and use their stock on ongoing needs, and therefore have limited response capacity in new regions or for scenarios not foreseen in their projects. Therefore in 2016, UNICEF put in place a modest contingency stock that would serve the scenarii identified through the interagency exercise, in order to reinforce Chad’s capacity. The relevance and need for such a stock, which is regularly used and needs to be renewed, remains very relevant in 2018. 
On the other hand, since 2015 UNICEF supports the Chadian government, in collaboration with other UN agencies such as OCHA, to develop its emergency management capacities. The government requested UNICEF’s support for the development of a National Contingency Plan, which was provided in 2017. However the existence of a plan is not enough to ensure adequate response capacity by the government. A roadmap was developed by the committee in charge of managing the National Contingency Plan that is meant to enable its dissemination and operationalisation. The roadmap will require substantial medium term support at both central and decentralized level. Certain clusters have agreed to include contingency support to their line ministries in 2018 within their sectoral plan, such as Education and WASH. Other NGOs support regional plans. However, it is urgent to make sure that these initiatives contribute to a coherent larger system which is not yet operational.

52768,2018,"366054",5684,"Tchad Plan de Réponse Humanitaire 2018","Health","3001","International Rescue Committee","Needs","Le contexte sanitaire du Tchad est dominé par une morbidité et une mortalité élevées dues principalement aux épidémies (méningite, rougeole, choléra ) et aux autres maladies transmissibles et non transmissibles. Des progrès ont été enregistrés et sont en lien direct avec les efforts du gouvernement pour améliorer les conditions sanitaires de la population. La dernière enquête statistique sur la population et les ménages, réalisée début 2015, constate que la mortalité infantile a baissé, passant de 91 % entre 2005-2009 à 72 % entre 2010 et 2014. Sur la même période, la mortalité juvénile a également baissé de 79 % à 65 %. La mortalité maternelle qui a reculé de 1099 décès pour 100 000 naissances à 860 pour 100 000 naissances demeure toutefois une préoccupation et une priorité dans tout le pays et nécessite une attention particulière. En effet, le Tchad est le troisième pays au monde avec le plus fort taux de mortalité maternelle.
Le faible développement du pays et la pauvreté généralisée sont des facteurs limitants importants à l’obtention de meilleurs indicateurs de santé.  Plus de 1,9 million de personnes n’ont pas accès aux services de santé et plus de 4,7 millions à l’eau potable. Le paludisme, disséminé dans tout le pays, représente la première cause de mortalité des enfants de moins de 5 ans. La présence des populations réfugiées ou déplacées apporte une charge supplémentaire sur les dépenses   de santé.
Dans la région du Lac, la persistance des attaques de groupes armés liés à Boko Haram contre la population civile et la recrudescence des incidents de protection depuis le mois d’avril 2017 a provoqué d’importants déplacements internes de populations. Selon le dernier rapport de situation d’OCHA / UNHCR (septembre 2017), 123,440 personnes déplacées y serait déplacées auxquelles s’ajoutent 12,759 personnes déplacées non enregistrées et  8,634 réfugiés. 
Le niveau des indicateurs de santé dans la région du Lac Tchad est préoccupant, comme le montrent les résultats de l’enquête MICS 2014-2015 : seulement 13,1% des femmes ont   effectué quatre consultations prénatales ou plus,  inférieure à la moyenne nationale de 31% et  10,6 % des accouchements  ont été réalisés par les prestataires qualifiés, inférieur à la moyenne de 33,9 % observé au niveau du pays. Seulement 4% des accouchements attendus étaient réalisés dans les structures sanitaires alors qu’au niveau national la moyenne est de 27,7%.
Les indicateurs de la planification familiale y sont également préoccupants. En 2015, les besoins non satisfaits de planification familiale étaient  de 15,5% inférieurs à la moyenne nationale de 22,9% avec une  prévalence contraceptive de 0,1%, inférieure à la moyenne nationale de 5%. Quant à  la santé des enfants, la couverture vaccinale complète est l’une des plus faibles du pays ;seulement 12,4 % des enfants étaient complètement vaccinés en 2015 ,  35% des enfants étaient vaccinés  contre la rougeole . 
Les activités proposées dans le cadre de ce projet viseront à atteindre les objectifs stratégiques 1,2 et 3  du plan de réponse humanitaire du Tchad pour 2018. L’IRC apportera son appui dans le secteur de la santé y compris la mise en place des mécanismes de riposte contre les épidémies  à environ 35226  personnes déplacées internes vivant dans les iles et sur la terre ferme dans le district sanitaire de Bol (Kaya, Ngalamia, Selea, Medi-koura, Medi-Kouta, Gomirom Doumou, Maar, Melea Dar Salam) , 4634 retournés  vivant dans le camp de Dar el Kheir dans le district sanitaire de Bagasola et environ  3000 personnes autochtones à travers les cliniques mobiles et l’appui à deux centres de santé et 2  hôpitaux  de référence pour la prise en charge des malades avec complications  médicales .

These difficulties are made worse by the political instability and the subsequent distribution in the payment of public salaries.   Meanwhile, the liquidity crisis is worsening (over 90% of Libya’s liquidity is estimated to be outside the banking system) and the Libyan Dinar (LYD) has continued to fall, from 4 LYD/USD in May 2016 8 LD/USD in August 2017. This has meant an increase in the cost of living, limited access to cash for citizens, and an inability of employers to pay salaries, which has increasingly made accessing basic services difficult."

• Selection of beneficiaries: ACTED will ensure participatory and inclusive selection processes, ensuring the buy-in and acceptance of different community and population groups as well as traditional leaders and local authorities.  ACTED will screen names sourced by local authorities and local organizations. 
• Project Monitoring and Complaints response mechanism (CRM):  The CRM allows beneficiaries and other community members to contact ACTED directly via phone or email in order to ask questions or express concerns. ACTED will ensure that beneficiaries are sensitized to the existence, the purpose and the processes of its CRM.  Furthermore, project monitoring will involve home visits to a sample of beneficiaries, further enabling beneficiaries to express their feedback.

REACH 2017 MNSA, Market Monitoring, and Market Assessment activities all indicate that markets are functional (items widely available and able to respond to changes in demand, prices fluctuating but continue to be continue to be monitored).  The value of the cash amount (370 LYD) has been calculated based on the gap between income and MEB in April 2017 in cooperation with the CMWG.

ACTED will liaise with all other actors delivering cash in the proposed areas of intervention (specifically Mercy Corps, Danish Refugee Council, and CESVI), to avoid overlap, share lessons learned, determine the scope for collaboration and complementarity.  ACTED will further coordinate with other NGOs working in the areas of operation to collect names of vulnerable households to feed into the beneficiary screening process.   

Furthermore, ACTED will ensure it also coordinates closely with relevant government agencies where functional. ACTED is registered with the Commission of Civil Society (CCS), the recognized body in Libya for coordinating all INGO operations and also submits narrative reports to CCS on quarterly basis, financial accounting reports, as well as annual narrative report summarizing project achievements. Local authorities will furthermore be involved in the design and implementation of the proposed action.

1. Protection needs/Gender/age analysis: the proposal is gender-informed and ACTED commits to disaggregating all project data by sex, age, disability, household status etc. (both program and AMEU data).  

2. Cash and Targeting: Households which are female-headed, displaced, have numbers of disabled, critically ill, or pregnant or lactating women households (often more vulnerable) will be considered a priority to ensure that ACTED supports women as actors with economic agency.

3. Protection sensitive complaints mechanisms: AME staff operating the CRM will have awareness on basic issues related to protection and gender and gender-based violence so that they can provide those affected with information on where they can obtain support in needed. 
Furthermore, ACTED is an active participant in the Protection Working Group, which will be leveraged to inform protection mainstreaming in the proposed intervention."

There are long term Sudanese refugees in eastern Chad, who have fled the conflict in Darfur. They are spread across 12 camps extending across several climatic zones, ranging from wooded savanna to near desert. In general, the northern camps are less well off than those further south, due primarily to the more limited access to livelihoods opportunities. Southern Chad hosts a number of long term refugees from CAR, as well as a smaller number of recent refugees who arrived in 2014 and 2015. These refugees live with their cattle herds with which they have crossed the border or acquired locally, increasing the pressure on shared natural resourcesTargeting has been completed in all five of the southern refugee camps, which generally have reasonably good access to land for cultivation and two camps to soudan. After the result of targeting performs in June 2017, an update will be made. Nevertheless, the “very poor” group is still the largest. Significant numbers of refugees from Nigeria began arriving in Chad in January 2015, fleeing the crisis the Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria. While earlier arrivals from Nigeria tended to settle within host communities, a dedicated site was prepared to house this wave of refugees"

De plus, il est prévu d’identifier des liens avec des projets de résilience (comme pour la création des actifs) qui ont eu lieu dans la zone auparavant et qui auront lieu dans l’avenir.

Par conséquent, il est à prévoir que de nombreux ménages n'auront ni les moyens ni les capacités pour faire face à la période de soudure (juin-septembre) en 2018. En 2018, environ 900,000 personnes auront besoin d’assistance alimentaire pendant cette période. Cette estimation est basée sur les résultats issus de l’analyse du Cadre Harmonisé de mars 2017.

UNHCR has standard monitoring and evaluation procedures mainstreamed in its operations management function. Implementing partners report to UNHCR on the implementation status every quarter, against the performance indicators and targets established through Project Partnership Agreements. Projects are monitored by UNHCR multi-functional teams (MFTs) composed of Protection, Program, Field, Technical, Supply and Project Control staff, through review of partner reports and through field visits (for direct observation and discussions with beneficiaries, partner personnel, local authorities and other stakeholders). Progress achieved in activities implemented by directly UNHCR is reviewed internally by the MFT on a monthly basis, against a direct implementation monitoring plan.

Evaluation of the project impact is carried out through data collection on the change in systems and in the life of UNHCR’s persons of concern, targeted by the project activities. Focus group discussions with project beneficiaries several times per year and surveys are used to collect the data, which is analyzed and used to inform future planning as standard operating procedures.  

Partners’ compliance with project management requirements and other provisions of the PPAs are verified on a quarterly basis. Activities implemented by UNHCR partners are also audited by independent auditors.

While designing the project, UNHCR takes into account the known key elements to ensure incorporating protection principles and promoting meaningful access, safety and dignity in humanitarian aid, these are: 

1 – Prioritize safety &dignity, and avoid causing harm: Prevent and minimize as much as possible any unintended negative effects of your intervention which can increase people's vulnerability to both physical and psychosocial risks.

UNHCR will design the implementation of its projects through partners in areas safe for access. Implementation of the activities will take into account gender sensitivity and will not be designed to expose any partner, key informant or participant in this monitoring tool to any danger.

2 – Meaningful Access: Arrange for people’s access to assistance and services – in proportion to need and without any barriers (e.g. discrimination). Pay special attention to individuals and groups who may be particularly vulnerable or have difficulty accessing assistance and services.

UNHCR’s will ensure that beneficiaries will have access to its activities through targeting the right locations and partners, who are well-operational in the field. The activities will be implemented in a gender sensitive manner, in quality and based on clear vulnerability criteria that partners will be trained on doing well. 

3 – Accountability: Set-up appropriate mechanisms through which affected populations can measure the adequacy of interventions, and address concerns and complaints.

UNHCR’s modus operandi includes participatory assessments, age, gender and diversity sensitive consultations with refugees and asylum seekers, complaints mechanisms including feedback to beneficiaries and other persons of concern, regarding the protection, assistance and durable solutions activities implemented by UNHCR and its partners.

4 – Participation and empowerment: Support the development of self-protection capacities and assist people to claim their rights, including – not exclusively – the rights to shelter, food, water and sanitation

This project aims at enhancing the protection environment of the targeted population and contribute to support “rights environment” of refugees and asylum seekers.  All activities will be implemented through participatory approach and with reference to key informants, chosen from the community as well-trusted source of information. Through monitoring and identification of key protection risks, refugees and asylum seekers will be fully aware of their rights and obligations and have to access that. UNHCR, through its program will support enhancing the rights environment. The cash is an important protection modality that will aim to enhancing the self-protection to avoid the targeted population to be put in at risk situation.

52496,2018,"51523293",5683,"Libya Humanitarian Response Plan 2018","Multi-sector","4397","United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees","Needs","The scale of population movements by sea from Libya grew exponentially in the past years as unprecedented numbers of individuals, including many who had lived in Libya for many years, took to the seas. Libya has ratified the 1969 Organization of African Union Convention; however, the country is yet to enact national legislation to provide the basis for a functioning asylum system. As a result, refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants entering Libyan territory without appropriate documentation, including those disembarked following rescue or interception at sea, are penalized for irregular entry and placed in detention centers/holding facilities run by the Department for Combatting Illegal Migration (DCIM). These centers generally do not meet the minimum standards of protection, and conditions have deteriorated further due to the conflict and economic crisis Libya. They are severely overcrowded, without adequate access to toilets or washing facilities, food, or clean water.
As of August 2017, 43,133 refugees and asylum seekers are registered with UNHCR in Libya, of the 63,000 estimated to be in the country. Syrians continue to represent the highest number of refugees and asylum seekers registered, accounting for 21,538 individuals (50%), followed by Palestinians (6,746; 15%), Eritreans (4,690; 11%), Sudanese (3,635; 8%) and Iraqis (3,108, 7%). UNHCR registers refugees and asylum seekers based on the seven nationality groups currently recognized by Libyan authorities as coming from refugee producing countries, hence only allowed registration by UNHCR.

Refugees and asylum seekers are the least resilient to the impact of the current crisis in Libya. They are more likely to have been displaced several times, to live in more vulnerable shelter types and to have been exposed to threats, intimidation, harassment, physical assault or violence. In reported cases of violence, a third of victims were women (compared to 20 per cent for IDPs and migrants), and a quarter were children, indicating further protection concerns for these groups. One in six refugees reported having been exposed to physical assault, and other common forms of violence against refugees including threats, intimidation and harassment, sexual harassment or abuse and theft or destruction of property. Refugees from sub-Saharan Africa face additional difficulties related to widespread xenophobia and discrimination. 

The majority of the refugees and asylum seekers are living in deteriorating situations, competing with the local population over access to scarce resources including public health and education. Furthermore, access to services is often discriminatory, and particularly for women and girls. UNHCR has observed a remarkable increase in the number of refugees and asylum-seekers who are totally dependent on UNHCR’s direct financial and health assistance.

They primarily reside in the main cities of Libya, especially in Tripoli, Benghazi and Misrata, and continue to face difficulties in finding affordable accommodation, usually share overcrowded flats, with negative impact on their overall wellbeing. Landlords often exploit the refugees’ vulnerable situation by demanding high rental fees, which in turn leads to forcible evictions as most of the refugees have no adequate sources of income, since they are not allowed to work and there are limited jobs available in the informal sector.

With the on-going crisis, deterioration of basic services and increasing competition over scarce resources with the Libyans, urban refugees often rely solely on UNHCR for assistance, thus a minimum level of material and financial assistance needs to be ensured.

UNHCR will provide CRI, non-food  items and access to basic health care to asylum seekers and migrants intercepted or rescued at sea.
2.	Direct multi-sectoral assistance 
UNHCR will provide vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers with shelter, assistance in kind and cash to cover the basic needs. UNHCR will re-activate the CDC in Benghazi and will open three CDCs in addition to the existing two. The activity includes psycho-social counselling, referral to specialized services, community-based activities, recreational and educational support, primary health care and access to information on available services.
3.	Assistance for durable solutions 
The protection environment in Libya offers limited durable solutions. For those who request to be repatriated voluntarily,  UNHCR will ensure that refugees have access to information and will assist with cash assistance in order for them to return to their country of origin in safety and dignity.  UNHCR will maintain good relations with the Ministry of Interior to follow up on exit visas. Other vulnerable refugees will be processed for departure to other countries through family reunification or resettlement. 
4.	Registration, profiling, documentation and status determination
UNHCR will strengthen the mechanisms for identification, registration, processing and protection of asylum-seekers and refugees. In cooperation with IOM and UNICEF, an early identification tool will be developed and piloted in order to facilitating information sharing and cross-referrals. 
5.	Protection monitoring of and release from detention centers 
UNHCR will work with the Libyan authorities to strengthen its protection monitoring in detention centers through regular visits. Interventions with the authorities will continue for release from detention of persons of concern to UNHCR. 
6.	Child protection
UNHCR will continue to advocate for enhanced child protection and conduct awareness campaigns about the refugee children’s situation. UNHCR will handle individual case management, seek durable solutions for children and continue best interest assessment (BIA) and best interest determination (BID).  Stable networks will be built with NGOs working with SGBV child survivors to start alternative care options. The cash assistance will continue to meet the needs of UASC and SGBV child survivors and care givers. Continued involvement of the refugee community will increase their awareness of CP/SGBV issues, to improve the identification of cases and implementation of safe and confidential referrals. 
7.	SGBV prevention and response
UNHCR will increase the number of identified SGBV cases, effective survivor centered case management and referral mechanism, and will provide cash assistance, NFIs, safe shelter and psychosocial counselling and medical assistance to survivors and their caregivers. Stable networks with NGOs working on SGBV prevention/response will be built and refugee communities will be engaged. UNHCR will advocate for more resettlement quotas since this is the only viable durable solution for most SGBV survivors. 
8.	Quick impact projects benefitting refugees, asylum seekers and host communities
UNHCR will promote peaceful co-existence between refugees and their host communities and an improved protection environment through quick impact projects (QIPs) benefitting the refugees and the local communities. Implementation of the QIPs will be based on a protection mainstreaming approach, including consultation with various age and gender groups of refugees on all phases of project planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
9.	Training, advocacy, capacity development of authorities and partners
UNHCR will continue its advocacy with, and capacity building of, the local authorities for protection of persons of concern. Workshops and conferences with high level officials will continue, as well as training of front line personnel.

According to DTM findings, the main problem associated with accessing NFIs was reported to be unaffordability for 89 per cent of baladiyas. In 10 per cent of baladiyas, quantity of NFIs was reportedly insufficient and in 1 per cent, the problem was reported to be the distance (distribution sites or shops being too far to access).

Regarding the returnee population, 91 per cent of identified returnees were reported to have returned to their previous homes.

La mission conjointe des partenaires du consortium mené dans le département Fitri et région du Guéra a fait ressortir les éléments suivants : insuffisance des infrastructures pastorales notamment les couloirs de transhumance, les puits pastoraux, les parcs de vaccination, les banques aliments betails, etc.
La zone du centre est caractérisée par une augmentation des zones de cultures, limitant ainsi la mobilité des troupeaux. Le non-respect des pistes de transhumance, croisé à l’extension des zones de cultures sont le plus souvent à la base des conflits éleveurs-agriculteurs. A cela s’ajoute l’absence des conventions locales de gestion concertée des ressources naturelles et le manque du schéma concerté d’aménagement d’hydraulique pastorale, Le manque du code pastoral au Tchad croisé à la méconnaissance des textes légaux régissant le foncier, le pastoralisme et l’exploitation des ressources naturelles, sont également sources de conflits entre les agriculteurs et les éleveurs. Le Département de Fitri est actuellement confronté à une forte pression du foncier pastoral et des ressources naturelles. Les éleveurs nomades vivant dans les zones de concentration durant la campagne de transhumances (décembre-juin), ont un accès limité aux services sociaux de base : la santé, l’éducation, l’eau potable et l’assainissement. L’absence d’un cadre formel de concertation multi-acteurs, ne facilite pas la prise en compte des défis de gestion intégrée des zones périphériques du Parc national de Zakouma, de la réserve de Siniaka Mina et des couloirs de migrations de grandes faunes sauvages dans le sud du Guéra (Barh Signaka). 
L’action proposée s’inscrit dans la Stratégie Nationale de Développement Pastoral publiée en mai 2016 en lien avec les 4 axes stratégiques (1, 2, 3 et 6) ci-après tel que définis dans les ateliers régionaux et, applicables à l’échelle nationale :
Axe 1 : Garantir l’eau destinée à l’abreuvement des troupeaux : Mise en place des ouvrages hydrauliques, construction/réhabilitation des puits pastoraux, des mares, aménagement des ouadis dans la zone de l’action
Axe 2 : Améliorer le service de soins aux animaux et de conseils aux éleveurs :. L’action propose un appui aux services sociaux de base notamment en santé animale et amélioration de l’état nutritionnel des populations nomades et hôtes, la formation des moniteurs nomades, la dotation des centres de santé en chaine de froid.
Axe 3 : Faciliter l’accès aux services sociaux de base : eau potable, éducation et santé : de même l’action propose également une amélioration des conditions d’accès à l’éducation à la santé et les conditions d’hygiène et nutritionnelle dans la zone de l’action.
Axe 6 : Prendre en compte la protection de l’environnement : Mise en place d’un cadre de concertation multi-acteurs, de gestion intégrée de l’élevage et de la faune sauvage autour du parc national de Zakouma et de la réserve de Seniaka Mina, et l’élaboration d’un schéma d’aménagement concerté agro-sylvo-pastoral et halieutique, ainsi que le schéma d’aménagement et de la gestion concertée des ressources.
La présente action s’inscrit dans le cadre d’un nouveau programme de développement pastoral et elle sera mise en place en complémentarité et en synergie avec les actions développées par Oxfam dans le Guéra, à travers les programmes PTSA/UE et Pro Act/UE qui ont pour objectif l’Amélioration de la situation alimentaire et nutritionnelle, le développement pastoral en mettant un accent sur le système d’information et d’alerte précoce.

•	Qatar Red Crescent: WFP will establish a regular communication and coordinate with QRCS especially in the south where according to the plan, there will be a potential risk of duplication and overlap. WFP will share with QRCS its targeting criteria and will complement the activities of QRCS.
•	Cooperation with partners of WFP: For implementation, WFP relied entirely on national third-party cooperating partners (CPs). Investing into CP capacity and continuously improving assessment and monitoring arrangements resulted in meeting quality standards. Local Crisis Committees (LCCs) identify the most food insecure households in their communities and provide WFP’s in-country CPs with a list. CPs then vet the lists based on WFP’s targeting criteria and send them to the WFP Country Office, which checks for inconsistencies. WFP then creates a distribution plan which is shared with CPs and WFP’s Third Party Monitor (TPM). The CPs inform beneficiaries through text message or local radio of the dates and locations of distributions. Food is then taken from the CP’s stock and distributed to beneficiaries.

The inability to provide for the minimum food requirements to reach or maintain a satisfactory nutritional status continues to be a widespread problem in Libya. The changing landscape of the conflict has generated further unprecedented population movements of IDPs and returnees. Some non-displaced people have also faced similar problem as a consequence of the economic stituation where cash is not available and the public distribution system is not longer functional. Migrants and refugees continue to face food and livelihood challenges.  Based on WFP/UNHCR global MOU, WFP will provide food to refugee population 5000 and above. UNHCR provided 20000 refugees defined as food insecure however, the number reached through WFP food assistance was 7000 this year. So the plan for 2018 will be 10,000. IOM has provided 20,000 migrants in detention centres, who are vulnerable and are in immediate need for food assistance. WFP will therefore target 10,000 beneficiaries based on the resource projection. Locations for the migrants will stay flexible until the discussions with IOM are done."

4-	Provide relevant training to the cooperating partners to enhance the operational capacity in different areas like finance, reporting, gender, protection, needs assessments…

For the time being, for its M&E activities, WFP relies exclusively on a Third Party Monitoring company that carries out onsite, warehouse, and post-distribution monitoring, including face-to-face interviews with beneficiaries and operates a telephone hotline. WFP systematically goes through a learning cycle to improve the process. After reviewing the monitoring and reporting received each month (or after each distribution cycle), WFP recommends corrective actions to be taken by the partners as related to the eight specified areas of improvement (distribution site, timeliness, distribution process, procedures, protection, security, visibility and communications).

WFP will collaborate with IOM to target the migrants in the intended detention centers and where appropriate, WFP will provide in-kind food assistance based on the prevailing food basket. Monitoring will be undertaken by IOM who has access to the detention centers. While detention centers is given the priority, WFP in collaboration with IOM and other agencies plan to conduct the food security needs of the rest of the migrants."

Il s’agit entre autres de :
•	Cartographie des points d’eau, Février 2017 ;
•	Enquête end -line et CAP dans les sites d’intervention Oxfam - Mars 2017 ;
•	Rapport de l’analyse de protection sur les sites de déplacés de la cuvette Nord du Lac Tchad réalisé par Oxfam – Mars2017 ;
•	Rapport de capitalisation sur la première phase de la réponse Mars 2017 ;
•	Rapport de mission d’évaluation de CCCM mai 2017 dans la zone kaiga Kindjaria.
•	Rapport d’évaluation multisectorielle à Kangalom en juin 2017
•	Monitoring régulier sur le terrain ;
•	Informations sécuritaires diffusées au niveau de la coordination (OCHA) ;
•	Monitoring mensuel des cas de protection réalisés par les équipes terrain
•	Rapport d’analyse de protection juillet 2017
•	Rapport de suivi épidémiologique des districts sanitaires de Bagasola et de Liwa
•	Rapport analyse genre, Oxfam aout 2017
L’analyse de ces différents rapports permet d’avoir un aperçu précis des besoins à couvrir dans les zones d’interventions pour l’année 2017. 
A cete effet, dans le domaine de la sécurité alimentaire et des moyens d'existence, Depuis l’éclatement de la crise liée à Boko Haram dans la région du Lac Tchad, Oxfam a pris une part active dans la réponse aux besoins des populations vulnérables. La satisfaction des besoins alimentaire et la protection des moyens d’existence a été un des axes majeurs de la stratégie d’intervention d’Oxfam dans la zone. Ainsi, depuis juin 2016 marquant le début de la réponse, d’importantes actions visant à répondre aux besoins en sécurité alimentaires et en protection des moyens d’existence des ménages vulnérables ont été menées. Il s’agit notamment de la distribution de cash inconditionnel pendant le pic de la période de soudure (juillet à octobre 2016) pour plus de 7000 ménages hôtes très pauvres (TP) et des  ménages déplacés internes (IDPs), la distribution d’intrants et outils agricoles pour la campagne maraîchère (octobre – décembre 2016) et la formation des producteurs (hôtes et déplacés) ayant accès aux terres de cultures, la facilitation de tables rondes de concertation sur l´accès à la terre pour les retournés et déplacés à Liwa, l’aménagement et la mise en valeur d’un site maraîcher à Loudjia irrigué par l’utilisation de la technologie photovoltaïque,etc. La deuxième phase de la réponse entamée depuis le mois de mai 2017, conçue sur la base des enseignements tirés de la première, a d’ores et déjà permis de soutenir les ménages vulnérables á travers la distribution du cash inconditionnel qui a touché 8 660 ménages déplacés et hôtes très vulnérables, soient environ 43 300 personnes composées de IDPs (77%) et des populations hôtes très vulnérables (23%). Parallèlement à cette distribution de cash réalisée pendant la période de soudure (juin-septembre 2017), l’intervention a mis aussi l’accent sur des activités qui contribuent á relancer les moyens d’existence des ménages. Il s’agit notamment de la distribution des intrants et matériels agricoles, les activités génératrices de revenus des femmes, la distribution des petits ruminants, la mise en place d’infrastructures productives (périmètres maraîchers), la prise en charge de la malnutrition par la distribution de supplément alimentaire (Blanket feeding), la mise en place d’un système de monitoring de la situation alimentaire au niveau des zones cibles. Toutes ces actions permettent actuellement d’observer des avancées significatives dans la couverture des besoins alimentaires des ménages et leur stabilisation dans les villages et sites d’accueil.

Primary governmental interlocutors include the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Health, as well as the Libyan Mine Action Centre (LibMAC) for the purposes of reporting and providing assistance to victims of explosive hazards. Handicap International is also an active member of the INGO Forum and Protection and Health Working Groups functioning in Tunis, whereby ongoing and planned interventions are coordinated amongst the sectors to ensure complementarity of services and avoid duplication of efforts. Handicap International also has the capacity in Libya for attending coordination mechanisms as soon as they’re established. Handicap International is part of the recently formed NGO coordination forum in Misrata for example. 

Handicap International has developed strong referral mechanisms over the last twelve months with national, international and governmental organizations, to ensure adequate and timely support can be provided to the most vulnerable persons identified through its Outreach activities.

The overall responsibility for the delivery of the project will be the program’s Head of Mission who shall maintain regular contact with other organizations operating in the same geographic areas for cross-checking information received from the field (peer monitoring). The Head of Mission and Project Coordinator will also establish direct and regular contact with the senior team of the supported health facilities for feedback in addition to regular scheduled communication with the Project Manager, Deputy Project Manager and the project teams using web-based technology for weekly team and operational planning meetings and weekly operational debriefs.
On a daily basis, the Project Manager will be responsible for the team planning, deployment and monitoring; including weekly field visits for quality assurance purposes. An internal Project Manager’s Tool Box will be set up for the project, which includes a detailed monitoring plan and will track project indicators against targets. File sharing will be done between the Project Manager and Information Management Officer with the programme management in Tunis via an online platform and shared KOBO accounts. Senior national staff including the Project Manager and Deputy, Field Coordinators and Administration Managers will visit Tunis at least once per month for face-to-face coordination with the programme management.

Do No Harm is practiced through continuous review of the project’s risk analysis, ongoing project monitoring and quality assurance and feedback mechanisms in place for beneficiaries and other stakeholders.
HI's beneficiary database is protected, and its Outreach teams will be trained to identify protection and vulnerability concerns of beneficiaries for confidential referral to appropriate services, upon consent from the individual.  HI’s Outreach teams will visit beneficiaries in their homes, to ensure that those unable to travel to health facilities can access services, and to avoid beneficiaries having to travel through sensitive or risky areas to reach assistance, thus building acceptance among targeted populations. Awareness raising activities will be conducted for health centre staff and local and international organization on inclusion of persons with specific needs to ensure that more vulnerable groups can access the scope of humanitarian assistance in Libya.
All persons with injuries or disabilities will be eligible for assistance through the project, regardless of status (IDPs, host community members, non-displaced, migrant or refugee) based on set vulnerability criteria which ensure team’s prioritization and targeting. 
Handicap International’s teams are gender balanced, ensuring that a female beneficiary can always be treated by a female psychosocial worker or physiotherapist if requested, and the same for male beneficiaries with male staff. For any beneficiary under the age of 18, Handicap International ensures that a parent or guardian of the child, and in most cases their caregivers, are present during the treatment session. 
At a global level, Handicap International is reviewing its implementation of the Do No Harm principle, with lessons learnt and recommendations intended to reach all interventions worldwide after the internal assessment is complete in early 2018.

These, along with post-intervention questionnaires to beneficiaries, provide affected populations with the opportunity to reach Handicap International with their feedback, requests or complaints, if needed. 

HI ensures accountability towards beneficiaries through the following ways:
1)	Households and individuals targeted directly by HI are always asked their consent to benefit from the project's activities. A refusal of intervention is always accepted.
2)	Beneficiaries are also asked if they accept an external referral before it is made. 
3)	In IDP camps and host communities, HI liaises with community focal points and key service providers as well as with the local population in order to ensure that community needs and priorities are central to the planning, implementation and monitoring of the operations.
4)	Beneficiaries can provide inputs and are consulted in decision-making processes: focus groups discussions and/or individual interviews with beneficiaries and community representatives will be organized in order to take into consideration their opinions and feedback on activities.
5)	HI has an established telephone hotline where affected populations can also reach the organization, to request services but also to provide any type of feedback on the services delivered or on the project.

52283,2018,"1489000",5683,"Libya Humanitarian Response Plan 2018","Protection","4763","Handicap International - Humanity & Inclusion","Needs","According to the Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) 2018 for Libya, more than 1 million people are in need of protection assistance across Libya and 70 per cent of this population is hosted in five mantikas: Tripoli, Benghazi, Misrata, Sirte, Ejdaba, with the elderly and people with mental and physical disabilities particularly vulnerable to violations of international human rights and humanitarian laws.
UNFPA’s MSNA 2016-17 also highlights that for persons with chronic diseases, disabilities and mental health issues, prior to the crisis, state subsidies allowed many to leave the country for treatment. With this subsidy no longer available to them, the vulnerability of this group of persons has been heightened, prompting the need for immediate humanitarian assistance.
According to Handicap International’s own Protection and Health programming in Libya since 2016, the ongoing conflict is exposing the life and health conditions of persons with disabilities and injuries to a rapid deterioration as Libya’s state health institutions continue to suffer: 
- The needs are growing: HI has a waiting list of over 1,000 persons with physical and functional limitations waiting for physical therapy, psychosocial support (PSS) and Prosthetic and Orthotic (P&O) services. A significant percentage of persons with physical limitations have sustained injuries in the last 6 months.
- Existing rehabilitation services are overloaded, and although there has been some improvement in the availability of primary healthcare in Libya (IOM's DTM May 2017), specialized services for persons with disabilities have been overlooked. Persons with disabilities without any support to improve their functional capacity are more vulnerable and likely to be left behind in crisis situations and more exposed to physical and sexual violence, exploitation, harassment and discrimination, leaving them with lasting physical and emotional consequences.
The escalation of violence and the rising number of wounded people continue to strain an already weak health system. In 2016, 1,610 casualties from explosive hazards were identified in Libya by the Libyan Mine Action Centre (LibMAC) and through Monitor media scanning; an increase on the 1,004 recorded in 2015. However, most hospitals do not have reliable and updated databases so casualty numbers were very likely under reported.

La malnutrition est un problème endémique au Tchad avec 40% des enfants de moins de 5 ans chroniquement malnutris. 29% des mères ont moins de 15 ans. Leurs enfants ont un risque plus élevé d'avoir un déficit pondéral (1 enfant sur 5 nait avec un petit poids). Par ailleurs, 5,5% des femmes pratiquent l'allaitement maternel exclusif jusqu'a 6 mois. Les pratiques alimentaires des enfants de moins de 5 ans demeurent très inadéquates dans la majorité des ménages dans les régions du Sahel. Seulement 5% des enfants bénéficient d'un régime alimentaire acceptable (EDS-MICS 2014-2015). Le faible taux d'alphabétisation des femmes (68% des moins de 15 ans sont analphabètes), certaines pratiques socio-culturelles (comme le mariage précoce), les mauvaises conditions d'hygiène et d'assainissement et les prévalences élevées de l'anémie chez les femmes enceintes et les enfants de moins de 5 ans, ainsi que le paludisme, viennent aggraver cette situation. Dans la région du Lac Tchad, la persistance des attaques des groupes armes lies a Boko Haram contre la population civile et la recrudescence des incidents de protection depuis le mois d'avril 2017 a provoqué d'importants déplacements internes de populations. Selon le dernier rapport de situation d'OCHA/UNHCR (aout 2017), il y aurait 123 440 personnes déplacées dans la région du Lac Tchad, auxquelles s'ajoutent 12 759 personnes déplacées non enregistrées et près de 8 634 refugies. Selon l'enquête SMART 2017, la région du Lac Tchad est dans une situation nutritionnelle très critique et nécessite une intervention d'urgence avec une MAG de 18,1%, une MAS de 3,4% et une MAM de 14,7%. La malnutrition reste toujours préoccupante comme le montrent les résultats des campagnes de dépistage de masse mensuel qu'organise IRC dans la période de Mai à Septembre 2017 auprès de 5 241 enfants de 6 à 59 mois dans 12 sites d'intervention du District Sanitaire de Liwa. Ces données indiquent que 15,8% d'enfants de cet Age souffrent de malnutrition aigue dont 3% de MAS. Ces dépistages ont mis aussi en évidence des écarts importants entre les sites lies au manque d'accès aux services de soins de santé et à l'eau potable, a l'insécurité alimentaire ou encore au manque de pratique d'hygiène adéquate. Malgré les interventions encours dans 8 sites, avec l'appui aux 7 centres de santé, on observe encore une insuffisance de : personnel qualifie, équipements et matériels médicaux et non-médicaux dans ces structures sanitaire. De surcroît cette intervention en cours ne couvre pas la totalité du District sanitaire. Les actions proposées dans le cadre de ce projet viseront à atteindre les objectifs stratégiques du plan de réponse humanitaire 2018 en matière de nutrition. IRC apportera son appui dans le secteur de la nutrition a 9122 personnes déplacées internes vivant dans les iles et sur la terre ferme dans le District sanitaire de Bol (Kaya, Ngalamia, Selea, Medi-koura, Medi-Kouta, Gomirom Doumou, Maar, Melea Dar Salam) et 4634 personnes déplacées dans le District sanitaire de Baga Sola(Dar El Kheir) à travers les cliniques mobiles et l'appui aux deux Centres de santé pour la prévention et la prise en charge nutritionnelle de qualité."

sustainable livelihood options, has resulted in a cycle of asset depletion for many Libyans,
displaced and non-displaced, returnees, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, whose
savings are gradually exhausted. The destruction of housing and lack of adequate shelter
options have led to housing shortages and an increase in rental prices, affecting the most
vulnerable population. The need for housing continues to stretch into urban areas in and around
the major cities, exacerbating the difficulties in securing affordable housing and putting an
increased number of families at risk of eviction."

UNHCR’s multi-functional teams will be responsible for project coordination internally, as well as with operational partners and other stakeholders including UN Agencies active in Libya, regional and local authorities.
 
UNHCR will conclude project partnership agreements with the selected international and national organizations and will provide them with guidance and support to strengthen their capacity as partner organizations. This guidance will focus on planning, designing budgets and monitoring in order to timely and effectively deliver results, as well as reporting in line with UNHCR’s rules and requirements and consistent with the donors’ requirements.
 
UNHCR is a leading agency in the Shelter and NFIs Sector and will ensure that implementation of all these activities will include close coordination through Shelter and NFI Sector Working Group (SSWG)."

While designing the project, UNHCR takes into account the known key elements to ensure incorporating protection principles and promoting meaningful access, safety and dignity in humanitarian aid, these are: 
1 – Prioritise safety &dignity, and avoid causing harm: Prevent and minimize as much as possible any unintended negative effects of the intervention which can increase people's vulnerability.
 UNHCR will design the implementation of its projects through partners in areas safe for access. Implementation of the activities will take into account gender sensitivity and will not be designed to expose any partner, key informant or participant in this monitoring tool to any danger. 
2 – Meaningful Access: Arrange for people’s access to assistance and services – in proportion to need and without any barriers (e.g. discrimination). Pay special attention to individuals and groups who may be particularly vulnerable or have difficulty accessing assistance and services. 
UNHCR’s will ensure that beneficiaries will have access to its activities through targeting the right locations and partners, who are well-operational in the field. The activities will be implemented in a gender sensitive manner, in quality and based on clear vulnerability crtieria that partners will be trained on doing well.
 3 – Accountability: Set-up appropriate mechanisms through which affected populations can measure the adequacy of interventions, and address concerns and complaints. 
UNHCR’s modus operandi includes participatory assessments, age, gender and diversity sensitive consultations vulnerable population groups, complaints mechanisms including feedback to beneficiaries and other persons of concern, regarding the protection, assistance and durable solutions activities implemented by UNHCR and its partners. 
4 – Participation and empowerment: Support the development of self-protection capacities and assist people to claim their rights, including – not exclusively – the rights to shelter.
 
This project aims at enhancing the protection environment of the targeted population and contribute to support “rights environment” of IDPs.  All activities will be implemented through participatory approach and with reference to key informants, chosen from the community as well-trusted source of information. Through monitoring and identification of key protection risks, IDP and returnees will be fully aware of their rights and obligations and have to access that. UNHCR, through its program will support enhancing the rights environment. The cash is an important protection modality that will aim to enhancing the self-protection to avoid the targeted population to be put in at risk situation."

Implementing partners report to UNHCR on the implementation status every quarter, against the performance indicators and targets established through Project Partnership Agreements. Projects are monitored by UNHCR multi-functional teams (MFTs) composed of Protection, Program, Field, Technical, Supply and Project Control staff, through review of partner reports and through field visits (for direct observation and discussions with beneficiaries, partner personnel, local authorities and other stakeholders). Progress achieved in activities implemented by directly UNHCR is reviewed internally by the MFT on a monthly basis, against a direct implementation monitoring plan.
 
Evaluation of the project impact is carried out through data collection on the change in systems and in the life of UNHCR’s persons of concern, targeted by the project activities. Focus group discussions with project beneficiaries several times per year and surveys are used to collect the data, which is analysed and used to inform future planning as standard operating procedures.

Partners’ compliance with project management requirements and other provisions of the PPAs are verified on a quarterly basis. Activities implemented by UNHCR partners are also audited by independent auditors."

At the time of the survey, 17.5% of hospitals, 20% of PHC facilities and 8% of other specific health services were closed. Benghazi region was the worst affected followed by south. 

Among the closed public hospitals (17 in total): 53 % were damaged; 23.5 - inaccessible, 23.5 - under maintenance. Among the non-functioning PHC facilities – 194 were PHC units, 73 – PHC centers and 6 – policlinic.  Out of total closed PHC facilities, 55% were under maintenance; 19 – in accessible; 14% - damaged; 12% - occupied by people/entities.

With so many fixed health facilities being closed and inaccessible, pre-hospital transportation and ambulance services have been seriously hampered by the prevailing security situation, occasional fuel shortages and poor communications; ambulances are lacking defibrillators, ECG monitoring and proper emergency medications; air ambulance services have collapsed.

En détails :
•	Dépistage et référencement des enfants : les enfants de 6-59 mois seront dépistés au début et à la fin de l’intervention et les cas de MAS/MAM seront référés dans les centres de santé. 
•	Distribution d’un paquet minimum WASH aux ménages ayant un enfant MAS : 
•	Distribution de cash: les ménages ayant des enfants de 6-59 mois pris en charge pour la MAS bénéficieront d’un transfert monétaire afin de protéger la ration donnée aux enfants MAS c’est-à-dire éviter la revente et/ou le partage des intrants reçus pour la prise en charge thérapeutique de la MAS ou du kit WASH. 
•	Education des mères aux pratiques clés d’eau, hygiène et assainissement : les mères d’enfants de 6-59 mois et les FEFA seront sensibilisées sur: gestion appropriée de l’eau de boisson (puisage, transport, stockage et utilisation de l’eau) ; hygiène (lavage des mains avec du savon, lavage systématique des fruits et légumes, des ustensiles de cuisine...); assainissement (gestion adéquate des excrétas, propreté de l’habitat ...) et la prévention de la malnutrition infantile. 
Afin de soutenir les actions précédentes, SI soutiendra et renforcera les moyens d’existence et la résilience des communautés bénéficiaires :
 •	Reconstruction des actifs : SI soutiendra plusieurs localités où les terres de décrue sont peu ou pas inondées à les aménager à travers la construction de diguettes en terres et l’appui conseil dans la mise en valeur. D’autres types d’ouvrages appropriés aux bas-fonds et/ou aux aires de pâturage seront réalisés pour améliorer leur fertilité et leur capacité de production.
Cette action se fera à travers 2 principales modalités : 
a) sous forme de Cash For Assets, les ménages participants recevront du cash en échange des travaux effectués. 
b) SI fournira des caprins afin de permettre à ces ménages de construire un capital qui les soutiendra en cas de choc. En outre, les chèvres procureront du lait aux enfants de 6-23 mois. Les caprins distribués auront été préalablement achetés aux éleveurs très pauvres de la zone (voir activité de déstockage ci-dessous). 
Les actions de renforcement des actifs sont adressées aux ménages « Très pauvres » ayant des enfants de 6-59 mois et des FEFA.
•	Renforcer les moyens de production : SI appuiera les localités dans lesquelles les potentialités à développer le maraîchage existent, avec une dotation en intrants et matériels agricoles et accompagnement technique. 
•	Renforcer les capacités locales à travers les mécanismes/services de stockage (BC/BAB) et les services agricoles et vétérinaires 
•	Déstockage préventif pour les ménages d’éleveurs très pauvres : Les revenus des éleveurs proviennent essentiellement de la vente d’animaux actuellement difficile du fait du ralentissement des échanges transfrontaliers avec le Nigeria et donc des prix de vente très bas. Afin de soutenir les ménages d’éleveurs, SI organisera une opération de déstockage en achetant à ces éleveurs, à un prix supérieur à celui du marché, 2 chèvres par ménage d’éleveurs « très pauvres"

5.3.2.	Besoins prioritaires identifiés 

A.	 Alimentation 	
En 2016, les retournés n’ont reçu de coupon alimentaire que 6 mois sur 12. En 2017, jusqu’en Mai, une seule distribution de coupon avait eu lieu. La distribution est de 100FR par personne par jour. Au lieu de 2100kcal/personnes/jour, c’est plutôt 1050kcal/personne/jour. 
La grande majorité n’ont pas d’autres ressources pour combler ce déficit. Dans cette situation, les femmes enceintes et allaitantes, les enfants de moins de cinq ans, les personnes âgées sont les premières victimes et les personnes à risque.

L’analyse de la situation de base ajoutée aux différents aléas telles que la baisse de production agricole (source : rapport du bilan céréalier campagne agricole 2016/2017), l’augmentation des prix des denrées sur les marchés et les mécanismes d’adaptation a montré que le résultat reste toujours médiocre. Ce qui laisse comprendre aisément que ces retournés vivent en dessous du seuil de survie. 

En perspective, afin d’augmenter la chance aux plus pauvres en situation d’insécurité alimentaire aigue, une catégorisation sociale devra être faite afin d’apporter de l’aide selon le dégrée de vulnérabilité et la catégorie socioéconomique. 

B.	Agriculture 
Elle est pratiquée dans les sites visités et les villages environnants. Mais, dans le site de Sido, vu le problème d’accès à l’eau, les retournés ne pratiquent presque pas la culture maraichère au profit de la   culture pluviale avec assez de difficultés liées à l’approvisionnement en semences pluviales tels que le mil, le sorgho, le niébé, le maïs et les boutures de manioc. Afin de survivre, les retournés ont développé   un mécanisme qui consiste à vendre les fagots qui génèrent des revenus pouvant leur permettre de subvenir à d’autres besoins alimentaires et non alimentaires. Cette utilisation des ressources ligneuses sans contrôle ni orientation technique peut constituer une menace à l’environnement.    

C.	Elevage
Dans tous les localités, à Maingama comme à Sido, l’on voit rarement les petits ruminants et volailles. Cette observation renforcée par des témoignages des retournés laisse croire qu’il y a la volonté de pratiquer l’élevage mais les appuis apportés ne couvrent pas les besoins de base (surtout les chèvres noyaux reproducteurs distribuées par la FAO dans les deux sites et villages).
L’élevage constitue une source de revenus non la moindre. Donc des appuis en volailles et petits ruminants pourront aider les retournés à se rétablir alimentairement et économiquement.
Dans le souci de stabiliser la situation économique des retournés vulnérables, il est conseillé de donner à chaque ménage à la fois des semences, des petits ruminants et/ou volailles.
D.	 Moyens de production
En termes de moyens de production, et dans l’optique d’une intégration socio-économique durable, dans les focus groupe et pris individuellement comme informateurs clés, les retournés des deux sites ont exprimé un besoin réel de bœuf d’attelage, des charrues et les houes.

52421,2018,"1209072",5683,"Libya Humanitarian Response Plan 2018","Food Security","4399","Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations","Needs","As of 2013, animal population in Libya was estimated to be around 150 000 cattle, 6 500 000 small ruminants, 110 000 camels, 12 000 horses and donkeys and 15 million poultry. 

Libya is one of the five countries in the Magreb region that has the epidemiological risk for many diseases and in particular for Trans-boundary Animal Diseases (TADs) as well as for zoonosis, involving Human and Animal health affecting livestock and public health as well as the economy of these countries, in particular for the most vulnerable people.

Livestock and animal production plays a key role in food security in Libya mainly as a source of protein and income for large segments of the population, especially the most vulnerable communities whose numbers have been increased since the escalation of the conflict in 2012.  

According to the FAO assessment carried out in August 2017, livestock health has degenerated considerably due to lack of vaccines, drugs and veterinary services as a whole (including surveillance) which could lead to the spread of zoonotic diseases.
Transboundary Animal Diseases (TADs) are considered as one of the biggest obstacles to livestock production and development in Libya.  This is in addition to existing production systems which are characterized by an extensive farming system-mainly nomadism.

The most important endemic diseases are: Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in cattle and sheep and goats, Bluetongue, peste des petits ruminants (PPR), Bovine brucellosis, Brucellosis in sheep and goats and Rabies (dogs). For the poultry sector, the Newcastle disease is one of the most important. Several other diseases such as contagious respiratory bronchitis (IB), inflammation of the larynx and trachea gastro ILT, chronic respiratory disease, Salmonella, and E. coli are notified

These diseases are a threat to food security, nutrition, livelihoods and internal or international trade. 

Pastoralists and agro-pastoralists have equally been affected by the ongoing conflict which has led to the deterioration of the food security situation in the country with 24 percent of IDPs categorized as food insecure and up to 62 percent at risk of sliding into food insecurity.  

The conflict has put a lot of pressure on the already dire economic situation which continues to deteriorate, deepening vulnerability of the affected population due to the depreciation of the Libyan currency, lack of liquidity in banks and proliferation of the shadow economy, supply chain disruption, rise in food and commodity prices.

The conflict has negatively impacted the income of IDPs, returnees and host communities, with most of them reporting that their income had decreased by up to 50 per cent since the escalation of the conflict.  Their main income source is now the state salary, which accounts for about 40 percent of their income. 

It is against the above background that FAO plans to provide support to the most vulnerable returnees and the non-displaced households through vaccination and treatment of livestock to control and reduce the spread of zoonotic diseases.  This will safeguard and protect the livestock which is one of the main food and income sources of the affected population.   The protection is to ensure that the most vulnerable segment of the affected communities, especially pregnant or lactating women, those with children under 5 years of age get access or continue to access milk products and animal proteins for a healthy growth and life.

UNHCR has standard monitoring and evaluation procedures mainstreamed in its operations management function. Implementing partners report to UNHCR on the implementation status every quarter, against the performance indicators and targets established through Project Partnership Agreements. Projects are monitored by UNHCR multi-functional teams (MFTs) composed of Protection, Program, Field, Technical, Supply and Project Control staff, through review of partner reports and through field visits (for direct observation and discussions with beneficiaries, partner personnel, local authorities and other stakeholders). Progress achieved in activities implemented by directly UNHCR is reviewed internally by the MFT on a monthly basis, against a direct implementation monitoring plan.

Evaluation of the project impact is carried out through data collection on the change in systems and in the life of UNHCR’s persons of concern, targeted by the project activities. Focus group discussions with project beneficiaries several times per year and surveys are used to collect the data, which is analyzed and used to inform future planning as standard operating procedures.  
Partners’ compliance with project management requirements and other provisions of the PPAs are verified on a quarterly basis. Activities implemented by UNHCR partners are also audited by independent auditors.

The Humanitarian Needs Overview clearly outlined that IDPs lacks proper access to food, education, health care services. UNHCR will therefore assist IDPs and IDP returnees to meet their basic needs through Cash based intervention. 

Despite several local reconciliation efforts and agreements which included measures to encourage their return, the majority of the protracted IDPs are unable to return back to their areas of origin in fear of retaliation, physical safety for them and their families. The IDP protracted situation is considered as one of the reason why reconciliation efforts are not yet yielding sustainable results. 
There is a need to enhance coordination with local municipalities, Ministry of Social Affairs, Ministry of Local Governance, Ministry of IDPs, Supreme Committee for IDPs and IDP Returnees, which are all key stakeholders in agreements/ arrangements that would contribute to enhance the protection environment for IDPs and IDP returnees. There is also a need to develop safeguards, to be adopted at national level, which would enhance their access to rights both in the places of displacement and in the places of return.

Moreover, the conflict in Libya has left the infrastructure and public services severely damaged or incapacitated, and the majority of the population in a dire economic situation. Assistance provided by UNHCR to IDPs is sometimes considered one-sided and frustration is growing among the host population at having to share their limited resources with the IDPs, without any support to respond to address their own basic needs. Similarly, the UNHCR assistance to IDP returnees, albeit limited and based on vulnerability assessments, there is a risk of growing tensions between those returning to their homes and those who never left during the conflict and who can barely cover their basic needs. Most of the local communities in Libya lack access to services and their long-term needs are not sufficiently addressed. Support to community-based service providers such as health centers, schools, market places will be essential to ensure peaceful co-existence between the IDPs and the local communities.

52436,2018,"15405892",5683,"Libya Humanitarian Response Plan 2018","Protection","4397","United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees","Activities or outputs","1.	Cash based intervention:
Cash will be provided based on vulnerability assessments conducted by UNHCR and/or partner staff. The cash grant is sized according to the minimum expenditure basket, calculated across sectors and agencies.
UNHCR and partners (all members of the CMWG) will use a combination of identified mechanisms (Cards (debit-pre-paid), Mobile Network Operators (MNOs)and Mobile Money (MM) Products) as well as bank transfers. These mechanisms and Financial service providers are detailed in the START report “Cash delivery mechanisms assessments for refugees, migrants and asylum seekers in Libya – Start Network https://startnetwork.app.box.com/s/76zpqoa7lsaxgxdophf5b8moa6y7suab”  
With the new delivery mechanisms, UNHCR and CBI actors should be able move activities at scale using sustainable systems. 

2.	Protection Monitoring: 
UNHCR will establish regular protection monitoring through partners, including data collection, consultation with various age, gender and diversity groups, assessment of their protection concerns for immediate interventions either directly or through referral to specialized services. Protection monitoring visits will also be used to disseminate information about the available services through group information sessions and printed materials. A webpage containing such information will be also developed and feedback will be sought during protection monitoring visits with regard to the IDPs’ and IDP returnees’ access to such information.
Moreover, UNHCR will strengthen its support to Libyan IDPs, IDP returnees and non-displaced Libyans, based on thorough needs assessments. Both the displaced Libyans and their host communities are in dire need of improved access to basic services which have significantly deteriorated as a result of conflict. The main assessment activities include but are not limited to protection needs assessments; urban displacement profiling (JIPS); market analysis and monitoring (CMWG); building damage assessment etc., in several locations of displacement and return.

3.	Capacity building of the humanitarian actors and duty bearers:
UNHCR will provide capacity building of all official institutions engaged in IDP protection and assistance in order to promote full adherence to international protection norms and humanitarian and human rights law and facilitate community based support for the communities and people affected by the conflict. 

4.	QIPs: 
UNHCR will promote social cohesion through a range of quick impact projects (QIPs) in locations where the needs have been highlighted, including Tripoli, Misrata, Sirte, Benghazi, Sebha and Ubari. Implementation of QIPs will be based on a protection mainstreaming approach, including consultation with various age and gender groups of IDPs of all backgrounds on all phases of project planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

While designing the project, UNHCR takes into account the known key elements to ensure incorporating protection principles and promoting meaningful access, safety and dignity in humanitarian aid, these are: 

1 – Prioritize safety & dignity, and avoid causing harm: Prevent and minimize as much as possible any unintended negative effects of your intervention which can increase people's vulnerability to both physical and psychosocial risks.

UNHCR will design the implementation of its projects through partners in areas safe for access. Implementation of the activities will take into account gender sensitivity and will not be designed to expose any partner, key informant or participant in this monitoring tool to any danger.

2 – Meaningful Access: Arrange for people’s access to assistance and services – in proportion to need and without any barriers (e.g. discrimination). Pay special attention to individuals and groups who may be particularly vulnerable or have difficulty accessing assistance and services.

UNHCR will ensure that beneficiaries will have access to its activities through targeting the right locations and partners, who are well-operational in the field. The activities will be implemented in a gender sensitive manner, in quality and based on clear vulnerability criteria that partners will be trained on doing well. 

3 – Accountability: Set-up appropriate mechanisms through which affected populations can measure the adequacy of interventions, and address concerns and complaints.

UNHCR’s modus operandi includes participatory assessments, age, gender and diversity sensitive consultations with refugees and asylum seekers, complaints mechanisms including feedback to beneficiaries and other persons of concern, regarding the protection, assistance and durable solutions activities implemented by UNHCR and its partners.

4 – Participation and empowerment: Support the development of self-protection capacities and assist people to claim their rights, including – not exclusively – the rights to shelter, food, water and sanitation

This project aims at enhancing the protection environment of the targeted population and contribute to support “rights environment” of IDPs.  All activities will be implemented through participatory approach and with reference to key informants, chosen from the community as well-trusted source of information. Through monitoring and identification of key protection risks, IDP and returnees will be fully aware of their rights and obligations and have to access that. UNHCR, through its program will support enhancing the rights environment. The cash is an important protection modality that will aim to enhancing the self-protection to avoid the targeted population to be put in at risk situation."

While some partners are already identified, others will be selected through standard partner selection procedures, which include a Call for Expressions of Interest, and identification of best-fit partners. UNHCR’s multi-functional teams will be responsible for project coordination internally, as well as with operational partners and other stakeholders including UN Agencies active in Libya, regional and local authorities.

UNHCR will conclude project partnership agreements with the selected international and national organizations and will provide them with guidance and support to strengthen their capacity as partner organizations. This guidance will focus on planning, designing budgets and monitoring in order to timely and effectively deliver results, as well as reporting in line with UNHCR’s rules and requirements and consistent with the donors’ requirements. 

UNHCR is a leading agency in the Protection Sector and will ensure that implementation of all these activities will include close coordination through the sector and the sub-sector, through Protection Working Group (PWG)."

52437,2018,"8000000",5683,"Libya Humanitarian Response Plan 2018","Protection","4293","United Nations Population Fund","Needs","Recent protection needs and monitoring assessments conducted among the IDPs in Libya indicate the that underreporting of GBV incidents is associated with weak reporting structures, cultural attributes and practices that leads to shame, stigma, fear of retaliation and the general lack of trust among service providers. Studies have also shown that the notion of domestic violence is regarded as a private matter thus explaining the reasons for family and community non-intervention. This further exacerbates a culture of tolerance and impunity while informal channels are predominantly used to access legal justice by female survivors of GBV because of fear of being exposed and publicly put to shame or blamed for the crime if they choose to use the formal justice system. It however remains unknown whether a woman’s wishes and rights are often respected when she chooses to use the informal justice system.  In addition, the collapsing economy has led to the struggle to meet basic needs further increasing women and girls risk to sexual exploitation and abuse, especially among the female head of Households which rose up from 13% in 2014 to 16% in 2016. This is further worsened by the multiple displacements especially those experienced in Tripoli and Benghazi, which has considerably diminished family sources of income. 

It is estimated that over 80,000 individuals have been affected by the clashes between the Militias in Sabrata, which erupted in September. Most of the population has been displaced in the neighboring areas of Surman, Janoub, Azzawa, South Sabrata , Al-Ayaylat and Al-Jameel. Among those affected by the conflict includes refugees, migrants and asylum seekers gathered in areas like Dahman by the Directorate of combarting illegal migrants (DCIM) while others are said to be surrounding detention centres such as Gharyan and Abu Ess and Zwara. Even though the exact number is unknown, but the migrants, refugees and asylum seekers affected by the conflict in Sabrata is estimated to be over 6,000 with some held in detention centres that are said to be in deplorable condition. 

The ongoing conflict continues to subject women and children to high risks of sexual exploitation and abuse as a result of the dangerous journeys they have to undertake on foot escaping from the conflict torn area of Sabrata to locations they consider safer such as Zwara. Their vulnerability is further exacerbated when they are put in overcrowded detention centres with poor living conditions and a lack of access to basic services. 

In addition, the breakdown of law has led to escalation of insecurity, including outbreaks of armed conflict and the proliferation of weapon threating the personal safety and security of the populations. Since the Islamic state seized control of Sirte, more than two thirds of Sirte’s 80,000 residents fled the area and sought refuge in the nearby town of Misrata. Many women have been widowed while others have been divorced leading to a high number of female headed households in need of assistance. Recent assessments have indicated a lack of protection services including psychosocial support. It’s also reported that GBV incidents are particularly high among the IDPs in the municipality while services for women who have experienced violence are insufficient. Women and girls in Misrata represents a particularly vulnerable group during displacement indicating the high need for coordinated GBV services. 

Structures to address minimum life-saving multi-sectorial services to prevent and respond to GBV are weak while in other locations, the services are overstretched or non-existent. Supply of post rape care kits remains low in most of the health facilities while emergency contraceptives are not available. In addition, no training has been provided to health staff on clinical management of rape. The general lack of a multi-sectorial GBV referral system and a functional GBV coordination mechanism is worrying.

Multi-sectoral response to GBV involves key services such as health, psychosocial support, safety and security and legal justice while other vulnerable women and girls might be in need of support related to shelter and NFIs and livelihoods. This project therefore seeks the collaboration with other sectors to ensure survivors have access to quality and comprehensive services. This will be enhanced through the development of functional and coordinated referral pathways. In addition, GBV is a cross cutting issue that will be prioritized for mainstreaming in all sector response activities, thus GBV mainstreaming trainings will be conducted for all the sectors and multi-sectoral actions developed to strengthen efforts for GBV risk mitigation.

UNFPA is building its intervention over several assessments and consultations with local and national partners (RMNCAH situation analysis, Multisectoral Needs Assessments, Service Availability and Readiness Assessment). In fact, according to the WHO Service Availability and Readiness Assessment, about 17% of the public hospitals and 20% of the Primary Health centers were closed and majorty of the hospitals in Libya are only partially functional. Under the same unbrella, Reproductive health services seem to be facing alarming accessibility, availability and quality rates. Only 12,1 of the health facilities in the south provide antenatal care with total absence of trained staff. As a result of the crisis, many public health facilities providing reproductive health (RH) care services, including emergency obstetric care are either damaged or difficult to access. The barriers women experience in accessing RH services include lack of information about where and when to seek care, unavailability of transport to health facilities, and high cost of services where available and accessible; all of which jeopardize timely interventions, particularly for safe delivery. In addition, the delivery services are limited to 8,5% of the health facilities in the South. In fact, there is only one hospital in Ghat (severity index 5) that is closed and with no maternity beds. Ubari with 28.5% of women in reproductive age being pregnant, has 100% of its hospitals non-functional or operating less than 25% of its capacity. Consequently, several maternal deaths are reported in the last two months; in Aljufra, one mother died with Intra-uterine fetal death (IUFD) while giving birth and a preterm triplet died after normal delivery within the same month and local sources in Ghat reported 5 women who died while giving birth. Additionally, Sabha Medical Center (SMC) remains the only secondary health facility with neonatale care that offers specialized delivery services to all people in the South of Libya. Without continuous support, the already overwhelmed SMC will collapse leading to catastrophic maternal and newborn deaths (such as the death of 73 newborns over 2 months in 2016). 
The very limited coping capacities and the geographic and tribal characteristics of the South requires specific intervention targeting both Primary and Secondary health centers strengthening human resources, service delivery, equipment and logistics and Health Information Systems."

5- Monitoring & Evaluation: UNFPA technical staff hired locally will carry out regular monitoring visits to the projects sites (when security situation allows) and hold regular coordination meetings with the implementing partners. As per UNFPA practices, UNFPA and the IPs will establish annual work plan with targets and indicators to ensure proper monitoring of activities.
UNFPA applies the Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfer (HACT) together with UNICEF and UNDP. This common tool is meant to strengthen the accountability framework in Libya since it agglomerates the monitoring resources and capacities of the three UN agencies.
Within HACT framework, spot checking assesses the accuracy of financial practices through a review of financial records and uses a risk-based approach that focuses on high-risk or unusual items, which allows for an efficient and effective monitoring and reporting of program expenditures.
Considering the different challenges related to the remote management and the security and political challenges that may hinder access to the targeted project sites, UNFPA will consider a remote monitoring mechanism, to complement the regular monitoring. UNFPA is using this approach in Syria response as well as in Iraq and has cumulated experience in working in hard-to-reach areas.
At the end of the project, UNFPA will conduct an external programmatic evaluation of the interventions involving partners and local NGOs, collect lessons learned and set the priorities for future interventions. An external audit will be also carried with the partners at the end of the financial exercise."

	There are considerable gaps in access to different types of health services in Libya, especially emergency services in urban areas have almost collapsed, emergency obstetric services, mental health and STD services are very limited.
	There are many gaps in access to information regarding different population groups, and especially children and adolescents.
	Access and use of prenatal services and health facilities for delivery have remained high, which is remarkable given the very low number (6%) of PHC that are able to provide delivery services. Infant and child mortality remain low in regional comparison, but there are reports that maternal mortality would be on increase. Incidence of malnutrition and anaemia in pregnant women are reported and the share of pregnancies ending with a miscarriage or still birth is almost 20 %. Use of post-natal services is low with just 44% of women using post-natal services.
	There are large regional and other discrepancies in nutrition of children. Levels of stunting, and possibly also underweight and wasted children appear to have increased considerably compared to 2007. Whilst PAPFAM (2007) gave 21% as the share of stunted children the figure was 38% in a recent (2017) survey.
	On the other hand, the inequality in access to healthy nutrition is reflected in the fact that almost 30% of Libyan children are overweight.

The project manager will work in close coordination with the Protection unit to ensure use of already established referral links and pathways between health and protection actors.  

Women and children, especially those displaced, are a specific target of the conflict in Libya. Violence against women and girls ranges from physical and verbal abuse to kidnapping (even trafficking) and gender-based violence (GBV), such as rape and other forms of sexual assault. GBV is a sensitive topic in Libya and widely understood to be underreported. There is no legislation in place regarding domestic violence or harassment, and there are few services available for women who have suffered from GBV. By providing medical assistance to GBV survivors, the project aims to support non-existing reporting mechanisms and feeding in to the GBV-Information Management System (GBV-IMS) which UNFPA is planning to set up in 2018. The health services assisted through the project will be used as an entry point to address the protection issues and will be addressed through IOM existing protection mechanisms which are closely coordinated with other partners/actors under the Protection sector.

IOM has an established Protection unit and its case workers are visiting urban areas where vulnerable IDPs are residing and through case management they are referring cases to the health unit for their immediate follow up. In parallel the protection unit is providing psycho-social support through community events and individual and group counselling and when cases in need of more in depth MHPSS support are identified those are referred to the health unit who can provide direct assistance or refer to relevant mental hospital."

52485,2018,"3000000",5683,"Libya Humanitarian Response Plan 2018","Health","2986","International Organization for Migration","How is your project coordinated?","IOM Libya makes use of its well-established network of local NGOs, CSOs and local crisis committees, securing their support throughout the implementation of the action. Given the difficult security situation in Libya, local partners are vital to ensure access to beneficiaries, as they are best placed to access, identify and respond to beneficiaries’ need. To implement the project, IOM Libya will work with partners already active in other IOM interventions.

The project will be implemented in close coordination and collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) (negotiation already in progress). IOM will identify the target health facilities and locations in coordination with the national authorities and support them through staff capacity building activities. The activities, especially the capacity building will be closely coordinated and partnered with WHO to avoid duplication and train the maximum number of health care providers in Libya. IOM and WHO are already organizing joint trainings and capacity building exercises for the health care providers in Libya in collaboration with MOH and NCDC. IOM will also coordinate with UNFPA on the SRH issues, including the GBV and contraceptives commodity security. In some areas, where any other organization is organizing similar interventions, IOM will closely coordinate to build synergies and avoid duplication, for example on the mobile outreach with IRC in Misrata. 

IOM will ensure regular monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanism throughout the project life. There is already a mechanism in place for other projects, which would be extended for this purpose. IOM has health staff on ground in different geographical areas of the country that carry out regular monitoring and supervision of the health activities, which will be used to collaborate with MOH/NCDC for monitoring of the project activities. The existing tools would be used and slightly modified (based on project needs) for this purpose. IOM will engage the national authorities (MOH & NCDC) to make the regular monitoring activity as a joint exercise. This will generate more ownership of the government and would lead to sustaining the activities beyond the project, especially at the health facilities level."

52485,2018,"3000000",5683,"Libya Humanitarian Response Plan 2018","Health","2986","International Organization for Migration","Needs","Since the start of the conflict, hundreds and thousands of Libyan populations have been displaced from their homes and reside in makeshift camps and dwellings. The recent round of DTM (Displacement Tracking Matrix) of IOM has identified and located 204,458 IDP individuals (40,854 households) across 85 baladiyas in Libya. The main Baladaya of residence and origin are Benghazi (20-34%), Ejdabia (9%), Misrata (9-11%) and Sirt (15%). Health, food and shelter are identified as the top priority needs by these displaced population. 
DTM also identified and located 301,988 returnees (an increase of 8% since the previous round) in 33 baladiyas in Libya during the reporting period who had returned between the start of 2016 and the time of data collection, where 54% of them are in the east of Libya.
In all these areas, the access to health care services is much compromised among other needs, and pose the risk of life-threatening outcomes, if not timely addressed. The extensive gaps were found in medical equipment, supplies, medicines, trained medical teams, linkages with referral facilities, social and health mobilization staff and processes, and diagnostic and screening equipment
The Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA 2) survey organized and conducted by WHO and MOH identifies acute shortages of life saving medicines and equipment across Libya, especially for life threatening diseases like TB, cancer, hepatitis, ARV, psychotropic drugs, anaesthesia etc. There are limited reagents and diagnostics material in the laboratories and regional blood banks. At the same time, there is lack of specialized human resources, like Specialist doctors, Nurses and midwives, staff working in A& E units, burn centres, OT, intensive care units etc. The SARA 2 identifies the same locations more in shortage of these requirements, where most of the IDPs and returnees are residing in match with the DTM data."

Children have been the victims of human trafficking; forced recruitment by armed groups, particularly in the southern region; abduction and torture by armed groups ; and of collateral damage from airstrikes and other targeted attacks. The psycho-social impact on children has been devastating and is further aggravated by the continuous exposure to violence and by their experience of forced displacement. Underage recruitment into armed groups and fighting forces is a key concern, especially among the radical groups including IS. According to assessment done by UNICEF in 2017 in the Al Jabal Gharbi Region there are around 3000 children and adolescent associated with armed groups. There is lack of social, and in some cases economic, opportunities for adolescents/youth to engage positively among themselves, and to make a meaningful and positive contribution to their families and communities. Additionally, there is the lack of supportive child protection and family welfare services within communities, including more focused specialized services for vulnerable children affected by armed conflict. Also, the presence and control of militias within communities in which children live, increases risk of association with armed groups, including the radical ones. Recruitment and use of children violates their rights and causes them physical, developmental, emotional, mental, and spiritual harm. At a most basic level, children are at risk of death and injury.  In addition, children on the move are the most vulnerable as they are affected by the irregular migration journey normally controlled by smugglers and armed groups."

52774,2018,"719636",5684,"Tchad Plan de Réponse Humanitaire 2018","Nutrition","3001","International Rescue Committee","Needs","Un total de 2,7 millions de personnes souffre de l'insécurité alimentaire au Tchad, dont plus de 900 000 en situation d'insécurité alimentaire sévère, soit une baisse de 1 million de personnes par rapport à la même période en 2016. En dépit de cette légère amélioration de la sécurité alimentaire, la situation s'est empirée dans certaines zones encore fragiles et la situation nutritionnelle reste préoccupante dans l'ensemble du pays avec près de 250 000 enfants atteints de malnutrition aigüe sévère attendus en 2018. Et la région du Lac est l'une des 4 régions du Tchad ou se trouve la forme sévère de l'insécurité alimentaire avec environ 12 000 personnes touchées. La malnutrition est un problème endémique au Tchad avec 40% des enfants de moins de 5 ans chroniquement malnutris. 29% des mères ont moins de 15 ans. Leurs enfants ont un risque plus élevé d'avoir un déficit pondéral (1 enfant sur 5 nait avec un petit poids). Par ailleurs, 5,5% des femmes pratiquent l'allaitement maternel exclusif jusqu'a 6 mois. Les pratiques alimentaires des enfants de moins de 5 ans demeurent très inadéquates dans la majorité des ménages dans les régions du Sahel. Seulement 5% des enfants bénéficient d'un régime alimentaire acceptable (EDS-MICS 2014-2015). Le faible taux d'alphabétisation des femmes (68% des moins de 15 ans sont analphabètes), certaines pratiques socio-culturelles (comme le mariage précoce), les mauvaises conditions d'hygiène et d'assainissement et les prévalences élevées de l'anémie chez les femmes enceintes et les enfants de moins de 5 ans, ainsi que le paludisme, viennent aggraver cette situation. Dans la région du Lac Tchad, la persistance des attaques des groupes armes lies a Boko Haram contre la population civile et la recrudescence des incidents de protection depuis le mois d'avril 2017 a provoqué d'importants déplacements internes de populations. Selon le dernier rapport de situation d'OCHA/UNHCR (2017), il y aurait 123 440 personnes déplacées dans la région du Lac Tchad, auxquelles s'ajoutent 12 759 personnes déplacées non enregistrées et près de 8 634 refugies. Selon l'enquête SMART 2017, la région du Lac Tchad est dans une situation nutritionnelle très critique et nécessite une intervention d'urgence avec une MAG de 18,1%, une MAS de 3,4% et une MAM de 14,7%. La malnutrition reste toujours préoccupante comme le montrent les résultats des campagnes de dépistage de masse mensuel qu'organise IRC dans la période de Mai à Septembre 2017 auprès de 5 241 enfants de 6 à 59 mois dans 12 sites d'intervention du District Sanitaire de Liwa. Ces données indiquent que 15,8% d'enfants de cet Age souffrent de malnutrition aigüe dont 3% de MAS. Ces dépistages ont mis aussi en évidence des écarts importants entre les sites lies au manque d'accès aux services de soins de santé et à l'eau potable, a l'insécurité alimentaire ou encore au manque de pratique d'hygiène adéquate. Malgré les interventions encours dans 8 sites, avec l'appui aux 7 centres de santé, on observe encore une insuffisance de : personnel qualifie, équipements et matériels médicaux et non-médicaux dans ces structures sanitaire. De surcroît cette intervention en cours ne couvre pas la totalité du District sanitaire. Les actions proposées dans le cadre de ce projet viseront à atteindre les objectifs stratégiques du plan de réponse humanitaire 2018 en matière de nutrition. IRC apportera son appui dans le secteur de la nutrition a environ 30 205 personnes déplacées internes dans le District sanitaire de Liwa (Bourora, Aliga, Chebrey,Kega, Moundi, Kiskawa, Haoura, Salia, Magui, Aborom, Koudoulou, Kadoulou) à travers les cliniques mobiles pour la prévention et la prise en charge nutritionnelle de qualité et l'appui  à l'UNT pour le traitement des enfants MAS avec complications medicales."

N.B : ACTED Tchad a mis en place un mécanisme de feedbacks et de plaintes centralisé au niveau de la coordination du pays et couvrant l’ensemble de ses projets. Ce mécanisme est géré de manière confidentielle par un staff indépendant en capitale. Les plaintes peuvent être communiquées au moyen d’une ligne verte, d’une adresse email et de boîtes à plaintes sur les sites de projet. L’ensemble des plaintes sont adressées dans un délai de 15 jours par la coordination selon les degrés de gravité. Ce mécanisme est présenté en amont des activités de chaque projet aux équipes de mise en œuvre, qui se sont engagés à respecter un code de conduite, ainsi qu’aux bénéficiaires à travers divers moyens de communication.
ACTED privilégie une approche participative à chaque étape de la mise en œuvre du cycle du projet, en particulier lors des évaluations de besoins et de la sélection des bénéficiaires à travers la consultation des différentes parties prenantes. Ceci afin d’assurer une approche inclusive de l’ensemble des bénéficiaires et notamment des populations les vulnérables (femmes, personnes malades, handicapées et/ou personnes âgées).  Au sein de la mission ACTED Tchad, une équipe d’évaluation et de suivi indépendante est formée à cette approche."

C’est notamment le cas dans les sous-préfectures de Doum-Doum, Kangallam et Kouloudia. A Kangallam, 88% de la population n’ont pas accès aux latrines et pratiquent la défécation à l’air libre. Pour ce qui est de l’accès à l’eau, 31% consomment à partir des eaux de surface, et 12% à partir de puits non protégés. A Kouloudia, 93% pratiquent la défécation à l’air libre. A Doum-Doum, un unique forage est utilisé par plus de 3000 individus alors que d’autres puits existants nécessitent une réhabilitation. De nombreux cas de diarrhée et de paludisme ont été identifiés, en particulier chez les enfants alors que les centres de santé les plus proches sont parfois éloignés de plus de 25km des habitations. De plus, la zone est une zone endémique du choléra et doit donc être sous vigilance du fait de sa proximité avec la frontière nigériane et camerounaise et de l'épidémie actuelle de choléra au Nigéria.
Par ailleurs, en plus du faible nombre d’infrastructure d’hygiène et d’assainissement dans la zone, la pression est exacerbée par la présence de plus de 6 000 personnes déplacées internes dans le canton de Kangallom. 
Le projet proposé par ACTED a pour objectif une amélioration de l’accès à l’eau, l’hygiène et l’assainissement pour les communautés de ces trois sous-préfectures, sur un ensemble de 25 villages représentant 45 000 individus (39 000 de populations hôtes et 6 000 de déplacés internes)."
